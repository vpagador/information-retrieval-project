Due to their connectivity, they are vulnerable to cyberattacks through various vectors including wired (e.g., CAN, Lin) and wireless (e.g., Bluetooth, WiFi) communications. To facilitate building and validating security measures against these attacks, it is vital to replicate the on-board networks and their components, along with a connected external environment representing required use cases and driving scenarios in an instrumental and controllable environment. In this paper, we propose a multi-component testbed representing a flexible and functional in-vehicle architecture for training and validating machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)."},

The article uses traffic data from the M42 and M6 motorways in the U.K. to investigate the probability of coexistence of other vehicles in the adjacent lanes, which induce interference and act as potential reflectors. The results show that the probability of coexistence of other vehicles in the adjacent lanes is lane-independent and it increases during the rush hours to 90%, while it decays to less than 10% during the off-peak and early morning hours. The intervehicular distance and the BER performance vary widely between different lanes and different periods of the day. The results also show that the BER performance of V2V-VLC system with non-line-of-sight (NLOS) component and with LOS component are comparable at rush hours. However, high BER values are predicted during the off-peak hours for NLOS components of the channel."},

The richness of real-world data required for testing autonomous vehicles is limited and furthermore, available data do not present a fair representation of different scenarios and rare events. Before deploying autonomous vehicles publicly, their abilities must reach a safety threshold, not least with regards to vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians. In this paper, we present a novel Generative Adversarial Networks named the Ped-Cross GAN. Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate crossing sequences of pedestrians in the form of human pose sequences. The Ped-Cross GAN is trained with the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. The novel Pedestrian Scenario dataset, derived from existing datasets, enables training on richer pedestrian scenarios. We demonstrate an example of its use through training and testing the Ped-Cross GAN. The results show that the Ped-Cross GAN is able to generate new crossing scenarios that are of the same distribution from those contained in the Pedestrian Scenario dataset. Having a method with these capabilities is important for the future of transport, as it will allow for the adequate testing of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles on how they correctly perceive the intention of pedestrians crossing the street, ultimately leading to fewer pedestrian casualties on our roads.

The proposed model combines the impact of inter-vehicle spacing and the radiation intensity distribution as a function of the irradiance angle which change with the traffic conditions. Three models (Lambertian, Gaussian and empirical) are utilized to examine the impact of vehicles headlights radiation pattern on the statistical path loss of VVLC system. The analytical model of channel path loss is validated by Monte Carlo simulation with the headlight model simulated with a raytracing software. The path loss values of the Gaussian model differ by 2 dB compared to the Lambertian model, irrespective of the traffic conditions while it differs by 24.6 dB during late night and 8.15 dB during rush hours compared to the empirical model of a Toyota Altis headlight. This variation shows that the radiation intensity distribution should be modelled for each vehicle's headlights from each manufacturer to ensure accurate VVLC channel model. The proposed Gaussian model provides a close approximation to describe such radiation pattern and can easily be adapted to model for different manufacturers headlights."},

Depending on what fixed step-size the MPPT controller implements, there is an impact on settling time to reach the maximum power point (MPP) and the steady state operation for conventional tracking techniques. This paper presents experimental results of an adaptive tracking technique based on Perturb and Observe (P&O) and Incremental Conductance (IC) for standalone Photovoltaic (PV) systems under uniform irradiance and partial shading conditions. Analysis and verification of measured and MATLAB/Simulink simulation results have been carried out. The adaptive tracking technique splits the operational region of the solar PV\u2019s power\u2013voltage characteristic curve into four and six operational sectors to understand the MPP response and stability of the technique. By implementing more step-sizes at sector locations based on the distance of the sector from the MPP, the challenges associated with fixed step-size is improved on.The measured and simulation results clearly indicate that the proposed system tracks MPP faster and displays better steady state operation than conventional system. The proposed system\u2019s tracking efficiency is over 10% greater than the conventional system for all techniques. The proposed system has been under partial shading condition has been and it outperforms other techniques with the GMPP achieved in 0.9 s which is better than conventional techniques."},

Evaluation must account for social, political, environmental and other conditions, such as flood state expectations and local priorities. The evaluation method should be able to quickly identify evolving investment needs as the incidence and magnitude of flood events continue to grow. Quantification is essential and must consider multiple direct and indirect effects on flood related outcomes. The method proposed is this study is a Bayesian network, which may be used ex-post for evaluation, but also ex-ante for future assessment, and near real-time for the reallocation of investment into interventions. The particular case we study is the effect of flood interventions upon mental health, which is a gap in current investment analyses. Natural events such as floods expose people to negative mental health disorders including anxiety, distress and post-traumatic stress disorder. Such outcomes can be mitigated or exacerbated not only by state funded interventions, but by individual and community skills and experience. Success is also dampened when vulnerable and previously exposed victims are affected. Current measures evaluate solely the effectiveness of interventions to reduce physical damage to people and assets. This paper contributes a design for a Bayesian network that exposes causal pathways and conditional probabilities between interventions and mental health outcomes as well as providing a tool that can readily indicate the level of investment needed in alternative interventions based on desired mental health outcomes."},

To coordinate the UAVs located in the sky, also called drones, the concept of the Internet of Drones (IoD) was introduced as overall coordination of UAVs in the sky. IoD paradigm offers a wide range of applications mainly targeting the military and civilian environments. Some of those applications include transportation, agriculture-based systems, entertainment, weather monitoring, healthcare systems, and road hazards monitoring. However, once an area is highly congested by a various number of drones, dynamic or statics obstacles can hinder the overall performance of drones. In order to avoid those obstacles, one of the proposed solutions is to apply collision avoidance techniques while the drones are on duty. In this paper, we present a brief survey of collision avoidance systems for the internet of drones. We have reviewed the current literature review ranging from the year 2010 to 2021. This work has taken into consideration two main frequently used databases in academia: Xplore for IEEE and ScienceDirect for Elsevier. After article selection, some articles were retained and discussed. A detailed discussion and analysis of selected articles were made while most of the techniques used in collision avoidance systems include video-based systems and swarm-based intelligence approaches. Furthermore, the paper discusses the different approaches which are used to design collision avoidance systems. Finally, this paper provides concluding remarks and future research orientation that will mainly focus on AI-based algorithms applied in collision avoidance systems."},

One recent aspect of the efforts to improve reuse rates in buildings is estimating the reusability of the structural elements. This study develops a probabilistic predictive model using advanced supervised machine learning methods to evaluate the economic reusability of the load-bearing building elements. The results of sensitivity analysis and visualization techniques used in this study reveal that the most important economic factor is the need to purchase reused elements early in a project, which could have cash flow implications. The other most important factors are the potential financial risks, the procurement process, and the labour cost. This study unveils that the relationship between variables is not linear, and none of the identified factors could alone determine if an element is reusable or not. This study concludes that the complex interdependencies of factors affecting reuse cause a high level of uncertainty about the feasibility of reusing the load-bearing building structural components from an economic aspect. Nonetheless, this paper reveals that by using the probability theory foundations and combining it with advanced supervised machine learning methods, it is possible to develop tools that could reliably estimate the economic reusability of these elements based on affecting variables. Therefore, the authors suggest utilizing the approach developed in this research to promote the circularity of materials in different subsectors of the construction industry."},

A few types of radiation like Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects often cause permanent damages on such nanoscale electronic devices, and current state-of-the-art technologies to tackle TID make use of expensive radiation-hardened devices. This paper focuses on a novel and different approach: using machine learning algorithms on consumer electronic level Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to tackle TID effects and monitor them to replace before they stop working. This condition has a research challenge to anticipate when the board results in a total failure due to TID effects. We observed internal measurements of the FPGA boards under gamma radiation and used three different anomaly detection machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect anomalies in the sensor measurements in a gamma-radiated environment. The statistical results show a highly significant relationship between the gamma radiation exposure levels and the board measurements. Moreover, our anomaly detection results have shown that a One-Class Support Vector Machine with Radial Basis Function Kernel has an average Recall score of 0.95. Also, all anomalies can be detected before the boards stop working. "},

The numerical results show that the achievable spectral efficiency lessens as the multipath fading and shadowing parameters decrease (i.e., severe multipath fading and heavy shadowing become prevalent) or the delay constraint increases. The  accuracy  and  tightness  of  the  proposed bounds is demonstrated and approximate representations are also provided to verify their usefulness. Furthermore, our numerical results are validated through a careful comparison with the simulated results."},

The risk of tardive frost damage in vineyards due to changing climate is considered as an important threat to the sustainable production of grapes. Therefore, the cold monitoring strategies is one of the criteria with significant impacts on the yields and prosperity of horticulture and raisin factories. Frost events can be characterized by duration and severity. This paper investigates the risk and impacts of frost phenomenon in the vineyards by modeling the joint distribution of duration and severity factors and analyzing the influential parameter\u2019s dependency structure using capabilities of copula functions. A novel mathematical framework is developed within this study to understand the risk and uncertainties associate with frost events and the impacts on yields of vineyards by analyzing the non-linear dependency structure using copula functions as an efficient tool. The developed model was successfully validated for the case study of vineyard in Malayer city of Iran. The copula model developed in this study was shown to be a robust tool for predicting the return period of the frost events."},

Under normality assumption for the genes, GRNs can be constructed by assessing the nonzero elements of the inverse covariance matrix. Nevertheless, such techniques are unable to deal with non-normality, multi-modality and heavy tailedness that are commonly seen in current massive genetic data. To relax this limitative constraint, one can apply copula function which is a multivariate cumulative distribution function with uniform marginal distribution. However, since the dependency structures of different pairs of genes in a multivariate problem are very different, the regular multivariate copula will not allow for the construction of an appropriate model. The solution to this problem is using Pair-Copula Constructions (PCCs) which are decompositions of a multivariate density into a cascade of bivariate copula, and therefore, assign different bivariate copula function for each local term. In fact, in this paper, we have constructed inverse covariance matrix based on the use of PCCs when the normality assumption can be moderately or severely violated for capturing a wide range of distributional features and complex dependency structure. To learn the non-Gaussian model for the considered GRN with non-Gaussian genomic data, we apply modified version of copula-based PC algorithm in which normality assumption of marginal densities is dropped. This paper also considers the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to determine the existence of a time delay relation between two genes. Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases in the world where GRN analysis of its subtypes is considerably important; Since by revealing the differences in the GRNs of these subtypes, new therapies and drugs can be found. The findings of our research are used to construct GRNs with high performance, for various subtypes of breast cancer rather than simply using previous models."},

The system is underactuated, legless and wheelless, and has potential applications in environmental inspection and operation in restricted spaces which are inaccessible to human beings, such as pipeline inspection, medical assistance and disaster rescue. Locomotion of the system relies on the stick\u2013slip effects, which interacts with the frictional force of the surface in contact. The nonlinear robotic model utilizes combined tangential-wise and normal-wise vibrations for underactuated locomotion, which features a generic significance for the studies on self-propelled systems. To identify the characteristics of the visco-elastic joint and shed light on the energy efficacy, parameter dependences on stiffness and damping coefficients are thoroughly analysed. Our studies demonstrate that the dynamic behaviour of the self-propelled system is mainly periodic and desirable forward motion is achieved via identification of the variation laws of the control parameters and elaborate selection of the stiffness and damping coefficients. A motion generation strategy is developed, and an analytical two-stage motion profile is proposed based on the system response and dynamic constraint analysis, followed by a parameterization procedure to optimally generate the trajectory. The proposed method provides a novel approach in generating self-propelled locomotion, and designing and computing the visco-elastic parameters for energy efficacy. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed model and motion generation approach."},

In particular, user-induced effects can lead to significant channel variations depending on the user equipment (UE) usage mode which in turn, can impact the quality of service. Estimation of UE operating conditions is therefore critical for optimal radio resource management. We propose a new approach to user activity recognition which makes use of both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. In particular, using information extracted from the received signal strength (RSS), a common metric readily available from many receiver chipsets, we perform a classification of user state (static or mobile relative to an access point) and UE mode of operation (voice call, using an app or in pocket). To develop and then train our classification system, measured RSS data was obtained using a custom 60 GHz measurement system for a range of indoor office scenarios which considered various UE to ceiling mounted access point configurations. In our approach, differentiation between static and mobile states is performed in preprocessing using a k-means algorithm. Small-scale fading features are then estimated from the RSS data and, using different feature scaling mechanisms, various supervised learning approaches are applied to investigate the optimal classification accuracy for the considered use cases in this work. We compare the classification performance of various window sizes and types, and show that a sliding window length of 1s without overlap performs best for time series segmentation at 60 GHz for the activities considered in this study. Among the different supervised learning approaches, the Decision Tree (DT) classifier performs best for both the user static and mobile cases with an accuracy of 100% and 98.0%, respectively. For static cases, user orientation, i.e., line-of-sight (LOS), quasi-LOS, and non-LOS, can also be classified and here the DT classifier also performs best with an accuracy of 98.2%, 97.6% and 100% for the voice call, using an app or in pocket use cases. Additionally, a feature ranking algorithm, called ReliefF, is adopted to determine the small-scale fading features that have the most significant influences on the classification accuracy and three different feature sets, namely Full, Reduced and Constrained sets, are then proposed based on feature ranking results. This allows the proposed techniques to be deployed on wireless platforms with different levels of processing capability."},

A 5-bit successive approximation register (SAR) quantizer is integrated into the chip, which reduces the number of comparators and the power consumption of the quantizer compared with flash ADC-type quantizers. An analogue passive adder is used to sum the input signals and it is embedded in a SAR ADC composed of a capacitor array and a dynamic comparator which has no static power consumption. To validate the design concept, the designed modulator is developed in a 180 nm CMOS process. The peak signal to noise distortion ratio (SNDR) is calculated as 106 dB and the total power consumption of the chip is recorded as 3.654 mW at the chip supply voltage of 1.8 V.

The main aim of this study is to develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, thus enabling risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making. Methods: Anonymised data consisting of 44 independent predictor variables from 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case\u2013control analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, required ventilatory support, and duration of inpatient treatment. Pulmonary embolism sequala was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were then learned and constructed using Bayesian networks. Results: The proposed probabilistic models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of the mentioned outcomes. Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable, quantitative predictive models for four outcomes, which utilise readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as risk stratification and clinical decision-making tools."},

Micro-Doppler radars are an appealing solution considering their non-intrusiveness, deep penetration, and high-distance range. Unsupervised activity recognition using Doppler radar data has not received attention, in spite of its importance in case of unlabelled or poorly labelled activities in real scenarios. This study proposes two unsupervised feature extraction methods for the purpose of human activity monitoring using Doppler-streams. These include a local Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)-based feature extraction method and a local entropy-based feature extraction method. In addition, a novel application of Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) feature extraction is employed for the first time for Doppler radar data. The three feature extraction architectures are compared with the previously used Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) and linear feature extraction based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and 2DPCA. Unsupervised clustering is performed using K-Means and K-Medoids. The results show the superiority of DCT-based method, entropy-based method, and CVAE features compared to CAE, PCA, and 2DPCA, with more than 5%-20% average accuracy. In regards to computation time, the two proposed methods are noticeably much faster than the existing CVAE. Furthermore, for high-dimensional data visualisation, three manifold learning techniques are considered. The methods are compared for the projection of raw data as well as the encoded CVAE features. All three methods show an improved visualisation ability when applied to the encoded CVAE features."},

It is shown that a multi-layer neural network (NN) with the proposed receiver scheme outperforms other machine learning (ML) algorithms and can offer high accuracy with root mean square (RMS) error of 0.22 m and 0.14 m during the day and night time, respectively.  Furthermore, the NN shows robustness in VLP across different weather conditions and road scenarios. The results show that only dense fog deteriorates the performance of the system due to reduced visibility across the road."},

This may be due to a variety of reasons. One of the reasons is that a mass of undissolved alumina may get enrobed by the cryolitic bath, and this mix freezes due to the decrease in temperature below the liquidus point. Thus, an electrically resistive solid layer (\u201cmud\u201d) is formed at a part of the cathode. This leads to horizontal electric currents in the liquid aluminum layer, and their magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) interaction with the vertical magnetic field induces a rotating flow of aluminum. This may cause undesirable MHD instabilities. A quasi-two-dimensional model for the laboratory facility has been presented. The results show that the dominating feature of the flow is a depression of the free surface of the liquid metal above the mud spot. This is due to strong rotation of the liquid metal around the mud spot, which causes the centrifugal force. Other effects may include superimposed conventional MHD instability, which manifests itself in a rotating interface, modulated waves, reflection of the waves from the corners of the domain, sloshing, etc. It has been shown that small mud spots do not affect the cell stability, while the large ones may cause such deep depressions that the centrifugal force completely removes the liquid metal above the spot."},

The aim of this paper is to outsource network coverage of a specific area according to a desired quality of service requirement and to enable various entities in the network to have intelligence to make autonomous decisions using blockchain and auction mechanisms. In this regard, by considering a multiple-UAV network where each UAV is associated to its own controlling operator, this paper addresses two major challenges: the selection of the UAV for the desired quality of network coverage and the development of a distributed and autonomous real-time monitoring framework for the enforcement of service level agreement (SLA). For a suitable UAV selection, we employ a reputation-based auction mechanism to model the interaction between the business agent who is interested in outsourcing the network coverage and the UAV operators serving in closeby areas. In addition, theoretical analysis is performed to show that the proposed auction mechanism attains a dominant strategy equilibrium. For the SLA enforcement and trust model, we propose a permissioned blockchain architecture considering Support Vector Machine (SVM) for real-time autonomous and distributed monitoring of UAV service. In particular, smart contract features of the blockchain are invoked for enforcing the SLA terms of payment and penalty, and for quantifying the UAV service reputation. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of theoretical analysis and efficacy of the proposed model."},

Due to the importance of issue and the lack of general statistics on these disorders among the Hospital staff treating the COVID-19 patients, this study aims to systematically review and determine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients.Methods In this research work, the systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression approaches are used to approximate the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. The keywords of prevalence, anxiety, stress, depression, psychopathy, mental illness, mental disorder, doctor, physician, nurse, hospital staff, 2019-nCoV, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and Coronaviruses were used for searching the SID, MagIran, IranMedex, IranDoc, ScienceDirect, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases. The search process was conducted in December 2019 to June 2020. In order to amalgamate and analyze the reported results within the collected studies, the random effects model is used. The heterogeneity of the studies is assessed using the I2 index. Lastly, the data analysis is performed within the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software.Results Of the 29 studies with a total sample size of 22,380, 21 papers have reported the prevalence of depression, 23 have reported the prevalence of anxiety, and 9 studies have reported the prevalence of stress. The prevalence of depression is 24.3% (18% CI 18.2\u201331.6%), the prevalence of anxiety is 25.8% (95% CI 20.5\u201331.9%), and the prevalence of stress is 45% (95% CI 24.3\u201367.5%) among the hospitals\u2019 Hospital staff caring for the COVID-19 patients. According to the results of meta-regression analysis, with increasing the sample size, the prevalence of depression and anxiety decreased, and this was statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05), however, the prevalence of stress increased with increasing the sample size, yet this was not statistically significant (P\u2009=\u20090.829).Conclusion The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients is high. Therefore, the health policy-makers should take measures to control and prevent mental disorders in the Hospital staff."},

The difficulty in fully collecting the required information related to student\u2019s financial status and the imbalanced-data classification problem caused by the small proportion of poverty-stricken students among total students makes it a challenging problem.  This problem results in a heavy workload for the college staff to identify poverty-stricken students, determine the amount of corresponding subsidy, and execute the supporting polices in an efficient way. Therefore, this paper attempts to address the above-mentioned challenges by proposing a smart campus system, which makes use of campus big data to identify poverty-stricken students and support the decision-making on the subsidy for them. The proposed system can also alert the counselors to provide psychological support for  students in trouble. The major contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, in addition to the features of students\u2019 amount of consumption on campus and its statistical characteristics used in existing researches, this paper proposes new features that describe diversity of consumable commodities, preference of consumption location and price, and characteristics of students\u2019 campus activities. Secondly, in order to solve the problem of dataset imbalance, four imbalanced data processing methods (Subsampling, Resampling, Costsensitive learning and SMOTE) have been applied to produce four different experimental datasets, and five classification algorithms (Random Forest, J48, Na\u00efve Bayes, SMO, Logistic regression) have been used to train the classification model on each dataset. The experimental results indicate that the model based on Resampling and Random Forest achieves the best performance in F1-measure of poverty-stricken students, among the combinations of four imbalanced processing methods and five classification algorithms. In addition, a method of quantization of subsidies, and strategies of early warning and counseling for students are also described in this paper. A system was developed based on the above-mentioned methods, which meets the needs of individualized and diversified support for poverty-stricken students. The methods and the proposed system have been put into practice, and it is serving more than 17,000 students. The system has significantly improved the efficiency and quality of student management, and reduced the workload of college staff"},

Specifically we focus on the uplink transmissions of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based LPWA networks consisting of multiple self-powered nodes and a NOMA-based single gateway. The self-powered LPWA nodes use the \"harvest-then-transmit\" protocol where they harvest energy from ambient sources (solar and radio frequency signals), then transmit their signals. The main features of the studied LPWA network are different transmission times-on-air, multiple uplink transmission attempts, and duty cycle restrictions. The aim of this work is to maximize the time-averaged sum of the uplink transmission rates by optimizing the transmission time-on-air allocation, the energy harvesting time allocation and the power allocation; subject to a maximum transmit power and to the availability of the harvested energy. We propose a low complex solution which decouples the optimization problem into three sub-problems: we assign the LPWA node transmission times (using either the fair or unfair approaches), we optimize the energy harvesting (EH) times using a one-dimensional search method, and optimize the transmit powers using a concave-convex (CCCP) procedure. In the simulation results, we focus on Long Range (LoRa) networks as a practical example LPWA network. We validate our proposed solution and we observe a $15\\%$ performance improvement when using NOMA. "},

Support vector machines (SVMs) are considered as efficient supervised learning approaches for classification due to their robustness against several types of model misspecifications and outliers. Kernel-based SVMs are known to be more flexible tools for a wide range of supervised learning tasks and can efficiently handle non-linear relationship between input variables and outputs (or labels). They are more robust with respect to the aforementioned model misspecifications, and also more accurate in the sense that the root-mean-square error computed by fitting the kernel-based SVMs is considerably smaller than the one computed by fitting the standard/linear SVMs. However, the choice of kernel type and particularity kernel\u2019s parameters could have significant impact on the classification accuracy and other supervised learning tasks required in network security, Internet of things, cybersecurity, etc. One of the findings of this study is that larger kernel parameter(s) would encourage SVMs with more localities and vice versa. This chapter provides some results on the effect of the kernel parameter on the kernel-based SVM classification. We thus first examine the effect of these parameters on the classification results using the kernel-based SVM, and then specify the optimal value of these parameters using cross-validation (CV) technique."},

As Long Range (LoRa) is currently one of the most prominent LPWA technologies, we propose in this paper a stochastic-geometry-based framework to analyse the uplink transmission performance of a multi-gateway LoRa network modelled by a Matern Cluster Process (MCP). The proposed model is first to consider all together the multi-cell topology, imperfect spreading factor (SF) orthogonality, random start times, and geometric data arrival rates. Accounting for all of these factors, we initially develop the SF-dependent collision overlap time function for any start time distribution. Then, we analyse the Laplace transforms of intra-cluster and inter-cluster interference, and formulate the uplink transmission success probability. Through simulation results, we highlight the vulnerability of each SF to interference, illustrate the impact of parameters such as the network density, and the power allocation scheme on the network performance. Uniquely, our results shed light on when it is better to activate adaptive power mechanisms, as we show that an SF-based power allocation that approximates LoRa ADR, negatively impacts nodes near the cluster head. Moreover, we show that the interfering SFs degrading the performance the most depend on the decoding threshold range and the power allocation scheme. "},

However, the battery aging effects due to the additional operation cycles caused by Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) service and the concern of the battery degradation are the main reason that keeps the customer from being the named prosumer of the grid. This paper proposes a novel active battery anti-aging V2G scheduling approach. Firstly, to evaluate the battery aging effect in V2G service, the battery degradation phenomenon is quantified by a novel use of rain-flow cycle counting (RCC) algorithm. Then, the V2G scheduling is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem, in which the minimal battery degradation and grid load fluctuation are designed as the optimization objectives. Finally, a multi-population collaborative mechanism, which is particularly designed for the V2G scheduling problem, is also developed to improve the practicability and performance of the heuristic optimization based V2G scheduling method. The proposed methodologies are verified by numerical analysis, which highlights that the proposed V2G scheduling method can minimize battery charge/discharge cycles by optimizing the time and scale of each V2G participant while providing the same services to the grid as expected."},

We benefit from the martingale theory and Poisson equations to prove and establish the convergence of the first passage time of reward processes to a zero mean Brownian motion. Necessary conditions to derive the results presented in this article are the existence of variances for sojourn times in each state and second order integrability of reward functions with respect to the distribution of sojourn times.

In turn, that is one of the factors deterring the commercialization of this technology. The forward Current-Voltage (I-V) characteristics in these devices carry considerable information about the material quality. In this context, an advanced Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) model is proposed and validated with measurements obtained from a fabricated and characterized Platinum/3C-SiC-on-Si Schottky Barrier Diode with scope to shed light in the physical carrier transport mechanisms, the impact of traps and their characteristics on the actual device performance. The model includes defects originating from both the Schottky contact and the hetero-interface of 3C-SiC with Si, which allows the investigation of their impact on the magnification of the sub-threshold current. Further, the simulation results and measured data allowed for the identification of additional distributions of interfacial states, the effect of which is linked to the observed non-uniformities of the Barrier Height value. A comprehensive characterization of the defects affecting the carrier transport mechanisms of the investigated 3C-SiC-on-Si power diode is thus achieved and the proposed TCAD model is able to accurately predict the device current both during forward and reverse bias conditions."},

We propose to extend the application of minimax filtering from state estimation in the radio frequency (RF) domain to intruder tracking using VLC. The performance of the proposed method was examined and compared with Kalman filter for both VLC and RF.

Within limits, this regulator ensures physical activity is completed without physiological system failure through interactive communications between the peripheral systems and the central systems. The ability of the central nervous system to regulate exercise is vital to optimise sport performance when severe intensity exercise might be required for prolonged or frequent periods. Based on mathematical models, this investigation explores the complex relationship between some of the mechanisms controlling physical activity and behaviour. In order to analyse the system control mechanisms, heart rate, volume of oxygen consumption and power output were measured for a well-trained male cyclist. Using power spectrum analysis, fractal analysis and continuous wavelet transforms, we show that the system control mechanisms regulating physiological systems, have distinct complexity. Moreover, the potential central controller uses specific frequency bands simultaneously to control and communicate with the various physiological systems.We show that pacing trials are regulated by different physiological systems."},

Increasing the generalization ability of multi-domain and imbalanced multi-class emotion classification of turn-level interactive Chinese texts poses the challenges due to its high dimension and sparse feature values in its feature space. Moreover, the properties of different feature spaces or diverse data distributions in various domains of target dataset (T) and source dataset (S) make it difficult to employ multi-class and multi-domain instance transfer. To address these challenges, we propose a data-level sampling approach for multi-class and multi-domain instance transfer which is inspired by transfer learning. To verify the validity of our proposed method, an imbalanced dataset is taken as target dataset, while three datasets, one collected from Bulletin Board System of Xi'an Jiaotong University and other two datasets collected from China microblog platform Weibo, as source datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms classic algorithms by alleviating the imbalanced problem in interactive texts effectively. Moreover, a classification model that is trained on immigrated datasets produced by employing our proposed method achieves the best ability of generalization. "},

The mining process may be time consuming for massive datasets. A widely used method related to knowledge discovery domain refers to association rule mining (ARM) approach, despite its shortcomings in mining large databases. As such, several approaches have been prescribed to unravel knowledge. Most of the proposed algorithms addressed data incremental issues, especially when a hefty amount of data are added to the database after the latest mining process. Three basic manipulation operations performed in a database include add, delete, and update. Any method devised in light of data incremental issues is bound to embed these three operations. The changing threshold is a long-standing problem within the data mining field. Since decision making refers to an active process, the threshold is indeed changeable. Accordingly, the present study proposes an algorithm that resolves the issue of rescanning a database that had been mined previously and allows retrieval of knowledge that satisfies several thresholds without the need to learn the process from scratch. The proposed approach displayed high accuracy in experimentation, as well as reduction in processing time by almost two-thirds of the original mining execution time."},

This fills a longstanding gap in the literature on the horizontal visibility approach to nonlinear time series analysis which, despite a suite of successful applications across multiple domains, lacks a formal setting in which to prove general properties and develop natural extensions. The main finding is that horizon visibility graphs are dual to merge trees arising naturally over a filtered complex associated to a time series, while horizontal visibility graphs are weak duals of these trees. Immediate consequences include availability of tree-based reconstruction theorems, connections to results on the statistics of self-similar trees, and relations between visibility graphs and the emerging field of applied persistent homology."},

A new approach is proposed in this work to overcome this problem while the motor is at steady state. In this paper, an industrial 6.6kV, 1.1MW induction motor is simulated with Finite Element Analysis (FEM) and its electromagnetic variables are analysed and studied under healthy state and several faulty conditions. The analysis of the stator current and stray flux waveforms is executed in both the transient and the steady state and aims to diagnose the challenging cases where the rotor breakages are nonconsecutive with regards to their spatial location. The results show the potential of flux analysis to fault severity regardless of the spatial position of the broken bars."},

However, it has not received enough attention compared to high-resolution images. Although high resolution images are more efficient for detection of land cover components, the analysis of low-resolution images are yet important due to the low-resolution repositories of the past satellite images used for timeseries analysis, free availability and economic concerns. The current paper addresses the problem of farm detection using low resolution satellite images. In digital agriculture, farm detection has significant role for key applications such as crop yield monitoring. Two main categories of object detection strategies are studied and compared in this paper; First, a two-step semi-supervised methodology is developed using traditional manual feature extraction and modelling techniques; the developed methodology uses the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), 2-D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and morphological features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifier modelling. In the second strategy, high-level features learnt from the massive filter banks of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are utilised. Transfer learning strategies are employed for pretrained Visual Geometry Group Network (VGG-16) networks. Results show the superiority of the high-level features for classification of farm regions."},

To address the challenge, in this paper, BS EN24T alloy (AISI 4340) has been used as a case study to conduct energy-efficient analysis and optimisation. Using a combination of experimentation and Taguchi analysis, the impact of the key machining parameters of CNC machining processes on energy consumption has been investigated in detail. A multi-objective optimisation model has been formulated, and a novel improved multi-swarm Fruit Fly optimisation algorithm (iMFOA) has been developed to identify optimal solutions. Case studies and algorithm benchmarking have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of the optimisation approach. The relationships between energy consumption and key machining parameters (e.g., cutting speed, feed per tooth, engagement depth) have been analysed to support process planners in implementing energy-saving measures efficiently. The optimisation approach developed is effective in fine-tuning key parameters for enhancing energy efficiency while meeting other technical requirements of production."},

Over 80% of such data is unstructured. Scientific research publications constitute a significant portion of such unstructured data.  Systematic literature review (SLR) is a rigorous and challenging process. The key challenge in SLR activity is the automatic extraction of the relevant data from the volume of publications. Lack of a unified framework has been identified as the key problem. A canonical model, based on the structure of the papers was proposed for data extraction purposes in SLR. Implemented as a classification problem, traditional machine learning models were used to realize the canonical model. A good accuracy was reported in these traditional models. However, there is room for improvement. This paper presents the result of the investigation of the same problem using convolutional neural network (CNN), which is more sophisticated (deeper). The results show an improvement over the traditional machine learning models with an accuracy of 85%.  Unlike the previous CNN NLP works, this work also demonstrates the application of CNN on a bigger NLP dataset such as the data from the scientific research publications. The result also shows that the CNN performs even better in NLP tasks with bigger datasets."},

We compared games played on touchscreen, with the same games played on two other platforms: console and PC. We measured three dependent variables related to gamer experience: ease of controls, ease of task completion, and satisfaction. We found that the value of touchscreens for gamer experience depends on the interaction of three factors: characteristics of players (their gaming background and preferences); types of games (their genre and design); and platform (their controls and affordances). We discuss how these interactions can be further understood and explored, and lay out a set of sensitivities and hazards to inform the future design of touchscreen games."},

The subsequent linear stability analyses of these flows (to disturbances stationary relative to the disk) indicate that isotropic and azimuthally-anisotropic (radial grooves) surface roughness leads to the stabilisation of both shear-thinning and -thickening fluids. This is evident in the behaviour of the critical Reynolds number and growth rates of both Type I (inviscid cross flow) and Type II (viscous streamline curvature) modes of instability.

In this paper we address these issues with a new non parametric classifier based on topological signatures. Our model learns classes as weighted kernel density estimates (KDEs) over persistent homology diagrams and predicts new trajectory labels using Sinkhorn divergences on the space of diagram KDEs to quantify proximity. We show that this approach accurately discriminates between states of chaotic systems that are close in parameter space, and its performance is robust to noise."},

Consequences of poor surface quality incur re-processing and higher wastes generating negative impacts on production costs and profitability. The complex relationships between surface quality and machining parameters could overwhelm machinists\u2019 capabilities to correctly select machining parameters to produce satisfied quality of machined workpieces. This paper presents a novel approach of designing an intelligent supervision controller for real-time adjustments on feed rate and spindle speed to achieve desired surface quality of machined workpieces. The controller is an innovative model-based closed-loop system, consisting of a surface roughness prediction model and a multi-variable controller, to ensure real-time improvements on surface quality during machining processes. A case study based on milling processes for BS EN24T steel alloy has been used for testing and validating the approach. Simulation results show that the controller significantly reduced the difference between required and predicted surface roughness from 3.6 \u03bcm (based on planned parameters) to 0.12 \u03bcm (after the supervision controller adjustments). The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively support high-quality machining processes."},

These advances in hardware compilers have resulted in significant increases in FPGA design productivity. In this paper, we investigate how to enhance an existing software-defined framework to reduce overheads and enable the utilization of all the available CPU cores in parallel with the FPGA hardware accelerators. Instead of selecting the best processing element for a task and simply offloading onto it, we introduce two schedulers, Dynamic and LogFit, which distribute the tasks among all the resources in an optimal manner. A new platform is created based on interrupts that removes spin-locks and allows the processing cores to sleep when not performing useful work.

Research has illustrated the need for additional \u2018sense-making\u2019 information to help households make informed energy-related decisions. This study investigates how household members respond when energy consumption data is integrated with information on indoor environmental conditions (IECs) and coupled with advice on energy saving actions. An integrated system of energy meters and IEC sensors was trialled in 19 predominantly social housing properties in the Midlands (England). Households were provided with a tablet computer and feedback was provided via a dedicated \u2018Energy Dashboard\u2019 web-based software application (app). The app was designed in collaboration with the social housing provider to display electricity and gas consumption data as well as data on three IECs: relative humidity, carbon dioxide and temperature. This paper draws on the findings from two rounds of semi-structured interviews with participants. All respondents using the app reported that they made use of the IEC data within the sense-making process, finding temperature and humidity to be useful in linking energy consumption, activities and household conditions. Interpretation of IEC data tended to increase with time as understanding increased. However, different users \u2018noticed\u2019, \u2018interpreted\u2019 and \u2018enacted\u2019 information differently as they integrated this with other sources of information, such as feedback from household members and experiential knowledge. The findings suggest that, whilst incorporating greater contextual information, such as IECs, into feedback displays can help users make sense of domestic energy consumption, the outcomes of the sense-making process will be different for different households. Nevertheless, the provision of such information appears to support householders to make decisions about their energy management that they feel appropriate for their household\u2019s wellbeing needs, within the bounds of their agency."},

Here, we develop a nonparametric method that uses Gaussian processes to accurately infer the dynamics of a metabolic pathway based only on metabolite measurements; from this, we then go on to obtain a dynamical view of the hierarchical regulation processes invoked over time to control the activity in a pathway. Our approach allows us to use hierarchical regulation analysis in a dynamic setting but without the need for explicitly time-dependent flux measurements."},

This approach offers flexibility to describe vehicles locations, speed and direction as well as stationary and non-stationary reflectors which are changing rapidly and continuously. The simulation results demonstrate that the LOS channel component is more affected by the direction of motion than the reflection component, whereas the reflection component is more affected by the relative speed of the vehicles."},

To recognize the three states of learners, three channel data is recorded: 1)video/image sequence captured by camera, 2)eye movement information from a non-intrusive and cost-effective eye tracker, 3)click stream data from mouse. Based on these modalities, we designed a multi-channel data fusion strategy to explore course learning performance predictions.

RNA-seq based transcriptome sequencing has been extensively used for identification of lncRNAs. However, accurate identification of lncRNAs in RNA-seq datasets is crucial for exploring their characteristic functions in the genome as most coding potential computation (CPC) tools fail to accurately identify them in transcriptomic data. Well-known CPC tools such as CPC2, lncScore, CPAT are primarily designed for prediction of lncRNAs based on the GENCODE, NONCODE and CANTATAdb databases. The prediction accuracy of these tools often drops when tested on transcriptomic datasets. This leads to higher false positive results and inaccuracy in the function annotation process. In this study, we present a novel tool, PLIT, for the identification of lncRNAs in plants RNA-seq datasets. PLIT implements a feature selection method based on L1 regularization and iterative Random Forests (iRF) classification for selection of optimal features. Based on sequence and codon-bias features, it classifies the RNA-seq derived FASTA sequences into coding or long non-coding transcripts. Using L1 regularization, 31 optimal features were obtained based on lncRNA and protein-coding transcripts from 8 plant species. The performance of the tool was evaluated on 7 plant RNA-seq datasets using 10-fold cross-validation.

We propose an approach to identify the performance boundary, where these corner cases are located, using Gaussian Process Classification. We also demonstrate the classification on an exemplary traffic jam approach scenario, showing that it is feasible and would lead to more efficient testing practices."},

This paper presents a review of recent developments in pedestrian and cyclist detection and intent estimation to increase the safety of autonomous vehicles, for both the driver and other road users. Understanding the intentions of the pedestrian/cyclist enables the self-driving vehicle to take actions to avoid incidents. To make this possible, development of methods/techniques, such as deep learning (DL), for the autonomous vehicle will be explored. For example, the development of pedestrian detection has been significantly advanced using DL approaches, such as; Fast Region-Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) , Faster R-CNN and Single Shot Detector (SSD). Although DL has been around for several decades, the hardware to realise the techniques have only recently become viable. Using these DL methods for pedestrian and cyclist detection and applying it for the tracking, motion modelling and pose estimation can allow for a successful and accurate method of intent estimation for the vulnerable road users. Although there has been a growth in research surrounding the study of pedestrian detection using vision-based approaches, further attention should include focus on cyclist detection. To further improve safety for these vulnerable road users (VRUs), approaches such as sensor fusion and intent estimation should be investigated."},

This leads to self-induced inter-carrier interference (ICI) in the SEFDM signal, which requires more sophisticated detectors to retrieve the transmitted data. In previous work, iterative detectors (IDs) have been used to recover the SEFDM signal after processing a certain number of iterations, however, the sequential iterative process increases the processing time with the number of iterations, leading to throughput reduction. In this work, ID pipelining is designed and implemented in software defined radio (SDR) to reduce the overall system detection latency and improve the throughput. Thus, symbols are allocated into parallel IDs that have no waiting time as they are received. Our experimental findings show that throughput will improve linearly with the number of the paralleled ID elements, however, hardware complexity also increases linearly with the number of ID elements."},

Besides traditional approaches that rely on wearable devices and camera systems, WiFi based technologies are materialising as a promising solution for indoor monitoring and activity recognition. This is, in part, due to the pervasive nature of WiFi in residential settings such as homes and care facilities. Moreover, WiFi based sensing is unobtrusive and minimally impinges on privacy. Advanced signal processing techniques are able to accurately extract WiFi channel status information (CSI) using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) devices or bespoke hardware. This includes phase variations, frequency shifts and signal levels. In this paper we describe a methodology that identifies Doppler shifts in the WiFi CSI, caused by human activities which take place in the signal coverage area. The technique is shown to recognize different types of human activities and behaviours, and subsequently facilitate applications in healthcare. Three experimental case studies based on empirical data are presented to illustrate the capabilities of WiFi CSI Doppler sensing in assisted living and residential care environments.

Furthermore, the algebraic representation of these models is rather tractable, which renders them convenient to handle both analytically and numerically. Based on this, the present contribution analyzes the ergodic capacity over the recently proposed \u03ba-\u03bc/inverse gamma composite fading channels, which were shown to characterize excellently multipath fading and shadowing in line-of-sight communication scenarios, including realistic vehicular communications. Novel analytic expressions are derived which are subsequently used in the analysis of the corresponding system performance. In this context, the offered results are compared with respective results from cases assuming conventional fading conditions, which leads to the development of numerous insights on the effect of the multipath fading and shadowing severity on the achieved capacity levels. It is expected that these results will be useful in the design of timely and demanding wireless technologies such as wearable, cellular and inter-vehicular communications."},

The technique is based on tree-structure sparse underdetermined blind source separation and utilizes proximal alternating methods in a convex optimization field. Firstly, we show proof-of-principle simulation results for two targets moving within a typical indoor scenario and compare the results with those from the well-known independent component analysis (ICA).

These requirements have led to the emergence of offsite construction manufacturing, which necessitates the use of automated machines. Compared to traditional onsite methods, offsite modular construction has a positive impact on quality, safety, cost, and productivity. Methodologies exist in the design of automated modular construction machines. This automation consists of not only the machines but also the supportive electrical and pneumatic systems, which, regardless of the design approaches used for automated machines, can be applied to the design of their associated systems. To avoid costly design changes, there is a clear need for a systematic and iterative design methodology at the conceptual design stage. For the control panel, the conceptual design method introduced in this paper facilitates the subsequent computer-aided design to be performed at the detailed design stage. Integrated function modeling, combined with axiomatic design and design structure matrix, constitutes the conceptual design approach for the control panel. In this work, linear time complex algorithm is developed for automating the layout of the electrical devices and wiring connections in order to facilitate computer-aided design implementation in the detailed design phase. Furthermore, the control panel guidelines and standards that constitute the prior knowledge of the design process are embedded in the algorithm."},

It is shown that C-V dependence is changed after trapping the localised charge in nitride layer. The change depends on position of the localised trapped charge. An n-channel transistor is considered with acceptor concentration in base of 1016 cm\u22123. By localising a charge bit with linear size of 80 nm in nitride layer, it is observed that capacitance jump in C-V dependence starts at some bias voltage applied to the source-base transition. This voltage depends on the position of charge bit. This dependence can be used in determining the charge bit position in the nitride layer along channel.

A Bayesian cooperative coalition game is formulated in which learning automata stationed at Radio frequency identification (RFID) readers are assumed as the players. These players form a coalition among themselves using newly defined payoff value function (PVF) based upon the communication cost, network bandwidth, and storage requirements. Each player in the game makes his best efforts to increase his individual PVF for which it selects one of the strategies from the strategy space using the conditional probability. For each action taken by the players, they may get a reward or a penalty from the environment according to which they update their action probability vector. Tags are arranged in acyclic directed graph, and a secure access control algorithm is proposed, which results a complexity of O(log(n)) in comparison with earlier solutions having the complexity of O(n). The proposed scheme is evaluated in comparison with other schemes by extensive simulations using various metrics. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is effective in maintaining the RFID-based secure data dissemination in the mobile cloud environment.

However, existing Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags, wearables and passive infrared (PIR) approaches require the user to carry dedicated electronic devices, suffer low detection accuracy and false alarm problems. This paper proposes a novel system for non-invasive human sensing by analyzing the Doppler information contained in the human reflections of WiFi signal. Doppler information is insensitive to the stationary objects, thus no requirement on scenario-specific calibration that makes it ideal for human sensing. We also introduce the time-frequency domain feature vectors of WiFi Doppler information for the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier towards activity event recognition. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a Software Defined Radio (SDR) system together with the experiment of five different events. The results indicate the proposed system is sufficient for indoor context-awareness with 95% overall accuracy in event classification and 84.8% PPV & 93.3% TPR in human presence detection which outperforms the traditional Received Signal Strength (RSS) approach (62.5% PPV and 83.3% TPR)."},

Informed decision making would certainly benefit from such predictions. Bayesian networks (BNs) and copulas are widely used for modeling numerous uncertain scenarios. Copulas, in particular, have attracted more interest due to their nice property of approximating the probability distribution of the data with heavy tail. Heavy tail data is frequently observed in financial applications. The standard multivariate copula suffer from serious limitations which made them unsuitable for modeling the financial data. An alternative copula model called the pair-copula construction (PCC) model is more flexible and efficient for modeling the complex dependence of financial data. The only restriction of PCC model is the challenge of selecting the best model structure. This issue can be tackled by capturing conditional independence using the Bayesian network PCC (BN-PCC). The flexible structure of this model can be derived from conditional independences statements learned from data. Additionally, the difficulty of computing conditional distributions in graphical models for non-Gaussian distributions can be eased using pair-copulas. In this paper, we extend this approach further using the minimum information vine model which results in a more flexible and efficient approach in understanding the complex dependence between multiple variables with heavy tail dependence and asymmetric features which appear widely in the financial applications."},

However, research investigating teachers' STEM roles and professional development through participation in outreach activities is limited. This paper explores teachers' views of STEM activities, how they understand their role as primary facilitators and the impact of their STEM engagement on their professional development. STEM outreach provides distinct opportunities for situated and dialogic learning. STEM teachers' effectiveness in engaging students by demonstrating the importance and relevance of STEM subjects in the real world and engaging captivating STEM outreach partners not only supports students learning but also enhances their opportunities to develop their knowledge and skills. Semi structured interviews were conducted with eleven teachers from six different schools in the West Midlands, United Kingdom. The data reveals STEM facilitators become the 'face' of STEM to their pupils. The expertise, knowledge and partnerships STEM facilitators develop, broadens their capacity to deliver teaching imbued with real world applications and improve students' understanding of the range of new and upcoming careers available. Most importantly, participating in STEM outreach activities help teachers maintain and reinforce their own sense of identity as STEM professionals. Outreach activities provide opportunities for teachers to interact with leading scientists and obtain exposure to cutting-edge research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]"},

In this paper,  an investigation on scattering regimes for underwater links using Monte Carlo simulation has been presented.While the focus of this paper is on diffuse links, the simulation results of collimated links is also provided for comparison purpose. Three types of water namely clear, coastal and turbid water are being used in the simulation. It is shown that the effect of scattering on the path loss cannot be accurately modeled by the existing channel model; ie. Beers-Lambert (BL) law.  It has been shown that  the distance at which the unscattered light drops to zero can be used to estimate the transition point for the scattering regimes in case of diffuse links. The transition point for diffuse links in coastal water and turbid water can be estimated to be around 22 m and 4 m respectively. Further analysis on the scattering order probability at different scattering regimes illustrates how scattering is affected by beam size, water turbidity and distance. From the frequency response plot, it is estimated that the bandwidth of several order of GHz can be achieved when the links are operating in the minimal scattering region and will reduce to several hundreds of MHz when the link is operating in multiple scattering region."},

Therefore, critical universality, which is a perturbative renormalization-group prediction, holds beyond the validity regime of perturbation theory. Most notably, dimensional reduction is restored at five dimensions, i.e., the exponents of the random-field Ising model at five dimensions and those of the pure Ising ferromagnet at three dimensions are the same."},

Analysis of real world financial scenarios require modeling of multiple uncertain quantities with a view to present more accurate, near future probabilistic predictions. Such predictions are essential for an informed decision making. In this article, the authors extend Bayesian Networks Pair-Copula Construction (BN-PCC) further using the minimum information vine model which results in a more flexible and efficient approach in modeling multivariate dependencies of heavy-tailed distribution and tail dependence as observed in the financial data. The authors demonstrate that the extended model based on minimum information Pair-Copula Construction (PCC) can approximate any non-Gaussian BN to any degree of approximation. The proposed method has been applied to the portfolio data derived from a Brazilian case study. The results show that the fitting of the multivariate distribution approximated using the proposed model has been improved compared to other previously published approaches."},

When considering fermionic operators, we follow the system's evolution by focusing on its reduced density matrix. The system is shown to be in a Gaussian state (at all time t) and the average number of particles is shown to obey the chaos game equation. Considering bosonic operators, with a system initially prepared in coherent states, the evolution of the system can be tracked by investigating the dynamics of the eigenvalues of the annihilation operator. This quantity is governed by a chaos game-like equation from which different scenarios emerge."},

The purpose of this study was to analyse a worldwide cohort of elite football players\u2019 perceptions of injuries due to a playing surface and to explore differences with the injury literature. The results can identify areas where future research should be focused to minimise the differences and ensure playing surfaces do not cause injuries perceived or otherwise. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected from 1129 players across the globe to address the aim of this study. Ninety-one percent of players believed the type or condition of a surface could increase the risk of injury. Soreness and pain were terms frequently used by players to describe the types of injuries they experienced and were often in relation to muscles or joints/bones. Abrasive injuries, along with soreness and pain were perceived to be greater on artificial turf. Surface type, surface properties, footwear, player attributes, adaptation and climate/time of the season were all potential risk factors identified by the players and linked to the playing surfaces. The results of this study suggest injury reporting should include measures of soreness or pain experienced by players. Potential risk factors such as switching between surfaces require further experimental studies to support the players\u2019 perceptions from varying surface experiences."},

A linear stability analysis is presented and we find that increasing the temperature dependence of the fluid (from gas- to liquid-type behaviour) results in an increased critical Reynolds number to a point of maximum stability. Using an energy-balance approach, we determine that this behaviour is primarily driven by the inviscid instability of the modified steady flow, rather than being a result of modified viscous instability effects.

Embracing the opportunities of parallel computing and especially the possibilities provided by a new generation of massively parallel accelerator devices such as GPUs, Intel's Xeon Phi or even FPGAs enables applications and studies that are inaccessible to serial programs. Here we outline the opportunities and challenges of massively parallel computing for Monte Carlo simulations in statistical physics, with a focus on the simulation of systems exhibiting phase transitions and critical phenomena. This covers a range of canonical ensemble Markov chain techniques as well as generalized ensembles such as multicanonical simulations and population annealing. While the examples discussed are for simulations of spin systems, many of the methods are more general and moderate modifications allow them to be applied to other lattice and off-lattice problems including polymers and particle systems. We discuss important algorithmic requirements for such highly parallel simulations, such as the challenges of random-number generation for such cases, and outline a number of general design principles for parallel Monte Carlo codes to perform well."},

Three galaxy samples (slices) with redshifts ranging within intervals 0.88\u00f70.91, 0.91\u00f70.94 and 0.94\u00f70.97 are studied as two-dimensional projections for the spatial distributions of galaxies. We construct networks and calculate network measures for each sample, in order to analyse the network similarity of different samples, distinguish various topological environments, and find associations between galaxy properties (colour index and stellar mass) and their topological environments. Results indicate a high level of similarity between geometry and topology for different galaxy samples and no clear evidence of evolutionary trends in network measures. The distribution of local clustering coefficient C manifests three modes which allow for discrimination between stand-alone singlets and dumbbells (0 \u2264 C \u2264 0.1), intermediately packed (0.1 < C < 0.9) and clique (0.9 \u2264 C \u2264 1) like galaxies. Analysing astrophysical properties of galaxies (colour index and stellar masses), we show that distributions are similar in all slices, however weak evolutionary trends can also be seen across redshift slices. To specify different topological environments we have extracted selections of galaxies from each sample according to different modes of C distribution. We have found statistically significant associations between evolutionary parameters of galaxies and selections of C: the distribution of stellar mass for galaxies with interim C differ from the corresponding distributions for stand-alone and clique galaxies, and this difference holds for all redshift slices. The colour index realises somewhat different behaviour."},

This paper proposes an alternative based on a multi-precision CNN frame-work that combines a binarised and a floating point CNN in a pipeline configuration deployed on heterogeneous hardware. The binarised CNN is mapped onto an FPGA device and used to perform inference over the whole input set while the floating point network is mapped onto a CPU device and performs re-inference only when the classification confidence level is low. A light-weight confidence mechanism enables a flexible trade-off between accuracy and throughput. To demonstrate the concept, we choose a Zynq 7020 device as the hardware target and show that the multi-precision network is able to increase the BNN accuracy from 78.5% to 82.5% and the CPU inference speed from 29.68 to 90.82 images/sec."},

Ten dimensions of entrepreneurship are considered. Two main findings are established with respect to the net effects of the interaction between mobile phones and governance dynamics.

In the event of AV incidents, ethical decisions will need to be made, e.g. a decision between colliding into one of three different AVs ahead on a multiple lane highway. A possible solution to the ethical problem is known as the utilitarian approach; this involves the AV steering into the collision path of least loss of utility, e.g. lowest injury level or number of fatalities. Deciding on the collision outcome of such ethical problems involves the investigation of a model-to-decision (M2D) approach. Thus, using a mathematical model of the collision scenarios to then make decisions based on the severity of each outcome as a measure of utility loss. This research investigates the use of such an approach for AVs in convoy on a three-lane highway. The mathematical model of an AV convoy collision that has been developed is of a nonlinear (bilinear) lumped mass spring configuration. This model is used in conjunction with a pragmatic multi-criteria decision maker (MCDM). The results from the M2D approach highlight the effectiveness of the utilisation approach on-board future AVs to minimise utility loss in terms of the severity of road traffic injuries and/or number of fatalities."},

One way to reduce building energy consumption is to adopt energy efficiency technologies and strategies. Due to environmental concerns and high cost of energy in recent years there has been a renewed interest in building energy efficiency and integration of renewable energy technologies. Active building envelope technology, i.e. transpired solar collectors (TSCs), provides a cost-efficient way of minimizing energy demand of buildings in accordance with global principle of sustainability, which has also proven reliable for diverse applications such as preheating fresh air delivery into the buildings and supplying domestic hot water in summer etc. The objective of this paper is to review the heat transfer and energy flow characteristics of the active building envelopes, particularly focusing on various types of TSCs. Present work consists of background and concept of TSCs, research literature for thermal performance, theoretical modelling, experimental study and numerical simulation investigation. Diverse mathematical models, including thermal models, air flow models, porosity models, and turbulence models etc., have also been presented and compared. Following that, more than 20 parameters affecting TSC performance have been analyzed and evaluated. The literature has illustrated that the best overall performance of turbulence model is RNG k-\u03b5; the effects of those parameters on TSC efficiency are completely different, depending on local climatic conditions, time and site constraints, and the interaction between different factors."},

The use of Petri nets to model ADLs is considered in this research as a means to capture the intricate behaviours of ambient systems. To our best knowledge there has not been extensive work in the related literature, hence the novelty of this work. The ADLs considered in the developed Petri net model are: (i) preparing tea, (ii) preparing coffee, and (iii) preparing pasta. The first two ADLs listed are deemed to have many occurrences during a typical day of an elderly person. The third activity is representative of activities that involve cooking. Hence, abnormal behaviour detected in the context of these activities can be an indicator of a progressive health problem or the occurrence of a hazardous incident. The completion and noncompletion of activities are considered in the developed Petri net model and are also formally verified. The description of the sensor system of the kitchen ADLs, its Petri net model and verification results are presented. Results show that the Petri net modelling of ADLs can reliably and effectively reflect the real behaviour of the examined system detecting all the activities of the users that can exhibit both their normal and abnormal behaviour."},

Friend recommendation, which is one of the important services in OSN, can help users discover their interested friends and alleviate the problem of information overload. However, most of existing recommendation methods only consider either user link or content information and hence are not effective enough to provide high quality recommendations. In this paper, we propose a topic community-based method via Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF). This method first applies joint NMF model to mine topic communities existing in OSN by combing link and content information. Then it computes user pairwise similarities and makes friends recommendation based on topic communities. Furthermore, this method can be implemented using the MapReduce distributed computing framework. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method not only has better recommendation performance than state-of-the-art methods but also has good scalability to deal with the problem of friend recommendation in large-sale OSNs. Moreover, the application case demonstrates that it can significantly improve friend recommendation service in the real world OSN."},

The nonlinear dynamics are much less sensitive to sheared flows than the average linear growthrates, and very small amplitude perturbations can lead to sustained turbulence. We explore the general problem of characterizing how and when the transition from near-laminar states to sustained turbulence occurs; a model of the interchange instability being used as a concrete example. These questions are fundamentally nonlinear, and the answers must go beyond the linear transient amplification of small perturbations. Two methods that account for nonlinear interactions are therefore explored here. The first method explored is edge tracking, which identifies the boundary between the basins of attraction of the laminar and turbulent states. Here, the edge is found to be structured around an exact, localized, traveling wave solution; a solution that is qualitatively similar to avalanche-like bursts seen in the turbulent regime. The second method is an application of nonlinear, non-modal stability theory which allows us to identify the smallest disturbances which can trigger turbulence (the minimal seed for the problem) and hence to quantify how stable the laminar regime is. The results obtained from these fully nonlinear methods provides confidence in the derivation of a semi-analytic approximation for the minimal seed. "},

The new gap-based approach is able to give accurate fault detection using any appropriate range of post-fault signal. Furthermore, the proposed method is fault resistance independent.

In intrusion detection, the most important constraints are the imbalanced class distribution, the scarcity of the labeled data, and the massive amounts of network flows. Moreover, because of the dynamic nature of the network flows, applying static learned models degrades the detection performance significantly over time. In this article, we propose a new semi\u2010supervised stream classification method for intrusion detection, which is capable of incremental updating using limited labeled data.

The reason for this interest is the machine's ability to operate as a brushless variable speed motor or generator through the use of a partially-rated power electronic converter connected to its second stator winding. Interest has increased in the last 20 years because of greater penetration of wind turbines with Doubly-Fed induction Generators (DFIGs) where brush gear and slip-ring maintenance and reliability have been a major issue. The BDFM appears in two forms, the brushless doubly fed induction machine (BDFIM), with two stator windings and a third closed rotor winding or the brushless doubly fed reluctance machine (BDFRM), with two stator windings and a reluctance rotor with no winding. This paper sets out to provide a rotor-centric view of BDFM operation, which shows the basis of its rotating flux pattern, aligning it with the known Natural Speed, and clarifying the synchronous and induction modes of operation of the BDFIM and the synchronous BDFRM. Based on rotor-centric view of the BDFM, it is shown that the conventional design methods for the BDFM stator back iron can be modified, leading to a lighter and smaller machine. The proposed design concepts are supported by analytical methods and their practicality is verified using 2-D Finite Element (FE) modeling and analysis of three experimental BDFMs."},

Bike sharing systems have been proposed as an interesting solution to deal with these problems. Nevertheless, shared vehicle schemes also arise problems that must be addressed such as the vehicle distribution along time and across space in the city. Differently to classic approaches, we propose the architecture for a muti-agent system that tries to improve the efficiency of bike sharing systems by introducing user-driven balancing in the loop. The rationale is that of persuading users to slightly deviate from their origins/destinations by providing appropriate arguments and incentives, while optimizing the overall balance of the system. In this paper we present two of the proposed system\u2019s modules. The first will allow us to predict bike demand in different stations. The second will score stations and alternative routes. This modules will be used to predict the most appropriate offers for users and try to persuade them."},

Due to internal and external factors, risks affect individual network nodes and their impact propagates through the network to affect other nodes. A Fuzzy Dynamic Inoperability Input/output Model (FDIIM) is developed to facilitate and analyse the risk and its propagation in global production networks (GPN), at the strategic level. This method applies fuzzy arithmetic to track and operate with uncertainty in GPN parameters and to estimate the confidence in the results obtained. The expert provides a judgement on relevant risk parameters\u2019 values in the form of linguistic values, where relevant statistical data is absent. We used the measure of ambiguity to measure uncertainty in the GPN parameters. Two types of analyses are carried out: (1) to examine the sensitivity of the FDIIM to changes in input parameter values, including interdependencies between GPN nodes, resilience of the GPN, intended revenues and impact of disruptions, and (2) to examine sensitivity to uncertainty in the GPN\u2019s input parameters. A generic GPN example and different risk scenarios are defined to illustrate these analyses. The analyses provide an insight into the importance of different GPN\u2019s parameters in the risk analysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated how to identify GPN parameters which are important to specify with less uncertainty.\n\nPublisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Computers & Industrial Engineering.

A citizen science survey was carried out at 38 sites, between 1st June and 30th September 2013. At the landscape scale, bumblebee abundance and species richness was not significantly correlated with surrounding land use characteristics (both p > 0.05). Bombus pratorum was the only species to show correlations with surrounding land use, demonstrating a positive relationship with built areas and gardens and allotments, and a negative correlation with greenspace and agriculture. At the local site-level scale, bumblebee abundance was negatively correlated with areas cultivated for vegetables and fruits, and positively correlated with areas cultivated for flowers, although neither correlation was statistically significant (p = 0.070 and p = 0.051 respectively). Bumblebee species richness was not correlated with either land use (p > 0.05). All bumblebee species were negatively correlated with areas cultivated for vegetables and fruit, bare ground and hard paving. Several flowering plants were visited by all bumblebee species, although relative preferences varied between bumblebee species. Results emphasise the importance of including floral resources within garden and allotment areas cultivated for food, and the need for a mosaic of different flowering plants to cater for varying floral preferences demonstrated by bumblebee species."},

The proposed method introduces a novel mechanism that dynamically updates the transition probability matrix through analysis of stochastic properties of the data as it is collected. The model gives high accuracy predictions on an object's immediate next movement using a range of orders with results ranging from 79% to 96% dependent upon the type of movement exhibited by the object and order of the model."},

Air is drawn into a virtual impactor where PM2.5 particles are separated and then deposited onto the SMR surface. The mass loading due to the fine particles is measured as a shift in the resonant frequency of the SMR working at 894 MHz.

In this article, with a resource-oriented approach, enterprise data resources are represented as data-centric Web services, grouped on-demand of business requirement and configured dynamically to adapt to changing business processes. First, a configurable architecture CIRPA involving information resource pool is proposed to act as a scalable and dynamic platform to virtualise enterprise information resources as data-centric Web services. By exposing data-centric resources as REST services in larger granularities, tenant-isolated information resources could be accessed in business process execution. Second, dynamic information resource pool is designed to fulfil configurable and on-demand data accessing in business process execution. CIRPA also isolates transaction data from business process while supporting diverse business processes composition. Finally, a case study of using our method in logistics application shows that CIRPA provides an enhanced performance both in static service encapsulation and dynamic service execution in cloud computing environment.\nThis is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Enterprise Information Systems on 3 Mar 2016, available online: http://www.tandfonline.com/10.1080/17517575.2016.115052 \n\n"},

It is of vital significance to thermal characterise of PCM to obtain phase change temperature range and the relationship of specific heat capacity with temperature (Cp-T). This is simply done by using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Present paper highlights the importance of experimental heating rate in thermal characterisation of PCM. It has been observed that the heating/cooling rate plays an important factor in studying numerically the charging/discharging behaviour of a PCM. Firstly the recommended heating/cooling rate of 10 \u00b0C/min stated in ASTM D 4419 is used for the DSC, followed by the rate of 0.2 \u00b0C/min observed in the experimental testing. The phase change temperature range and the Cp-T curves have been determined for the both heating/cooling rates. An experimentally validated CFD model has been developed aiming to predict the thermal performance of PCM and the air outlet temperatures. The effective heat capacity method is applied including the Cp-T obtained from the DSC for both rates. Similar heating rate, as per experimental testing, established significant improvements in the validation results when applied in a CFD model."},

It is estimated that about 10% of English households live in fuel poverty.2015 UK greenhouse gas emission final figures show that the net CO2 emission was reduced by 4.1% between 2014 and 2015. This shows that the UK is on course to attain its second carbon budget with annual 2013-2015 emissions that are each below the estimated level for the period. However, the housing sector lags with a 4% increase in emissions over the same period. More work needs to be done in this sector. Householders can adopt more efficient energy use approaches and make better lifestyle choices to save money and have a safer environment. This research addresses government priorities to reduce energy demand, meet CO2 reduction targets, and reduce domestic reliance on fossil fuels, offering protection from price risks and fuel poverty as well as providing more affordable and comfortable domestic environments. The proposed research paper deals with novel interaction methods on energy use in social housing and how the aforesaid issues can be reflected on. A detailed background study on existing interaction methods and ongoing development of a serious game trialled in 19 households has been carried out. It has been noted that displaying real-time utility use and indoor environmental conditions to householders increased awareness and impacted how energy is being consumed. Furthermore, the proposed paper will investigate end use energy profile pattern changes due to novel interaction methods (if any)."},

For the pure systems our results support the early scaling predictions for the size dependence of the interfacial adsorption at both first- and second-order phase transitions. For the disordered systems, the interfacial adsorption at the (disordered induced) continuous transitions is discussed, applying standard scaling arguments and invoking findings for bulk critical properties. The self-averaging properties of the interfacial adsorption are also analyzed by studying the infinite limit-size extrapolation of properly defined signal-to-noise ratios."},

The sensor system operates in a differential mode with two SMR devices driven by Pierce oscillators. The active resonator was spray-coated with a selective polymer compound, while the second one was used as a reference. The absorption of vapor molecules into the polymer layer causes a frequency shift in the resonator. A study of suitable polymer coatings and finite element simulations on the sensor response were performed. Experimental results demonstrated that the VOC monitor is capable of detecting toluene concentrations down to 5 ppm with a high sensitivity of 60 Hz/ppm for a 180 nm PDMS polymer coated SMR resonating at 900 MHz. We believe that the system could be used as a robust, low-cost and low power microsensor for the real-time and ubiquitous monitoring of VOCs, particularly in a personal air quality monitor."},

Making decisions within a medical domain is difficult due to the existence of high levels of uncertainty. The sources of this uncertainty can be due to the variation of physicians' opinions and experiences. The structure of existing FCMs is based on type -1 fuzzy sets in order to represent the causal relations among concepts of the modeled system. Therefore, the ability of the FCM to handle high levels of uncertainties and deliver accurate results can be hindered. In this paper, we propose using the Interval Agreement Approach to model the weights of links in FCMs to capture high level uncertainties in the presence of imprecise data acquired from different medical experts to enhance its decision modelling and reasoning capability. The proposed model is used in identifying if a child is diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) where the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers is used as a standard tool to derive the inputs for the FCMs. Initial results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional FCMs in classifying ASD based on a dataset of diagnosed cases."},

The paper also reports some preliminary progress on the design flow to program the structure.

Here, we tap into this structural advantage and present a highly optimized implementation of the population annealing algorithm on GPUs that promises speed-ups of several orders of magnitude as compared to a serial implementation on CPUs. While the sample code is for simulations of the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model, it should be easily adapted for simulations of other spin models, including disordered systems.

Fuzzy relevance profiles were created using Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) analysis for the successful user queries. Fuzzy rule based summarisation was used to integrate the three profiles into a unified index reflecting the semantic weight of the query terms related to the task, user and document.

PIN-FORMED plasma membrane proteins, involved in intercellular transport of the growth regulator, are key to the transmission of such auxin signals and subject to multilevel surveillance mechanisms, including reversible post-translational modifications. Apart from well-studied PIN protein modifications, namely phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, no further post-translational modifications have been described so far. Here, we focused on root-specific Arabidopsis PIN2 and explored functional implications of two evolutionary conserved cysteines, by a combination of in silico and molecular approaches. PIN2 sequence alignments and modeling predictions indicated that both cysteines are facing the cytoplasm and therefore would be accessible to redox status-controlled modifications. Notably, mutant pin2C\u2212A alleles retained functionality, demonstrated by their ability to almost completely rescue defects of a pin2 null allele, whereas high resolution analysis of pin2C\u2212A localization revealed increased intracellular accumulation, and altered protein distribution within plasma membrane micro-domains. The observed effects of cysteine replacements on root growth and PIN2 localization are consistent with a model in which redox status-dependent cysteine modifications participate in the regulation of PIN2 mobility, thereby fine-tuning polar auxin transport."},

Thirty-six individuals signed up to take part in the study, and 27 respondents took part in the final evaluation survey. Findings: Testing by health and social care professionals found there is scope for using the app as a digital self-assessment tool by people at risk of falls. It has further potential as an effective tool to support environmental/behavioural change to reduce risk of falls. Conclusion: FallCheck was developed from a sound evidence-base to support home-hazard modification as an effective intervention component within a multifactorial intervention to prevent falls. Health and social care professionals found it had good acceptability for use in practice, justifying further testing of the usability and effectiveness of the app in supporting behavioural changes and environmental modifications with people at risk of falling and carers."},

It becomes more challenging for the emerging users because of scarcity of bandwidth. To overcome the unforbidden challenges in the advanced technologies like smart cities, 5G and Internet of Things (IoT), Cognitive Radio provides the solution to achieve high throughput and continuous connectivity for reliable communication. A primary challenge in the Cognitive Radio (CR) technology is the identification of dependable Data Channels (DCHs) for Secondary Users (SUs) communication amongst the available channels, and the continuation of communication when the Primary Users (PUs) return. The objective of every SU is to intelligently choose reliable DCHs, thereby ensuring reliable connectivity and successful transfer of data frames across the cognitive networks. The proposed Reliable, Intelligent and Smart Cognitive Radio protocol consumes less computational time and transmits energy with high throughput, as compared to the benchmark Cognitive Radio MAC (CR-MAC) protocols. This paper provides new applications of CR technology for IoT and proposes new and effective solutions to the real challenges in CR technology that will make IoT more affordable and applicable."},

The geographic coordinate systems could be used to produce new traveling salesman problem (TSP) instances with geographic information systems (GIS) features. The current paper introduces a recurrent framework designed for building a sequence of instances in a systematic way. The framework intends to model real-life random adverse events manifested on large areas, as massive rainfalls or the arrival of a polar front, or targeted relief supply in early stages of the response. As a proof of concept for this framework, we use the first Romanian TSP instance with the main human settlements, in order to derive several sequences of instances. Nowadays state-of-the-art algorithms for TSP are used to solve these instances. A branch-and-cut algorithm delivers the integer exact solutions, using substantial computing resources. An implementation of the Lin\u2013Kernighan heuristic is used to rapidly find very good near-optimal integer solutions to the same instances. The Lin\u2013Kernighan heuristic shows stability on the tested instances. Further work could be done to better exploit GIS features in order to efficiently tackle operations on large areas and to test the solutions delivered by other algorithms on new instances, derived using the introduced framework."},

Firstly, we show the instability in liquid\nmetals, which are relatively poor conductors, differs significantly from the astrophysically relevant Tayler instability. In liquid metals, the instability develops on the magnetic response time scale, which depends on the conductivity and is much longer than the Alfv\u00e9n time scale, on which the Tayler instability develops in well conducting fluids. Secondly, we show that this instability is an edge effect caused by the curvature of\nthe magnetic field, and its growth rate is determined by the linear current density and independent of the system size. Our results suggest that this instability may affect future liquid metal batteries when their size reaches a few meters."},

A current paradigm is that the corresponding dissipation increases with the intensity of the magnetic field and as a result turbulent fluctuations are all the more damped as the magnetic field is strong. While this idea finds apparent support in the phenomenology of decaying turbulence, measurements of turbulence in duct flows and other, more complex configurations have produced seemingly contradicting results. The root of the controversy is that magnetic fields promote sufficient scale-dependent anisotropy to profoundly reorganize the structure of turbulence, so their net effect cannot be understood in terms of the additional dissipation only. Here we show that when turbulence is forced in a magnetic field that acts on turbulence itself rather than on the mechanisms that generate it, the field promotes large, nearly two-dimensional structures capturing sufficient energy to offset the loss due to Joule dissipation, with the net effect of increasing the intensity of turbulent fluctuations. This change of paradigm potentially carries important consequences for systems as diverse as the liquid cores of planets, accretion disks, and a wide range of metallurgical and nuclear engineering applications."},

The study adopted a retrospective, comparative design using a postal questionnaire in three English councils with adult social care responsibilities in 2012\u201313. Included in the study were 1,341 budget users aged 75+, living in ordinary community settings. The overall response rate was 27.1 per cent (339 respondents). Three validated scales measured outcomes: EQ-5D-3L (health status), the Sheldon\u2013Cohen Perceived Stress Scale and the Adult Social Care Outcomes Toolkit (social care-related quality of life).

The main concept of sensorless control of drives relies on additional information given by the machine during its normal operation. This information provided by the machine is essentially the Back Electro Motive Force and the variance of the stator inductivity, which are dependent on the rotor position. Several approaches and methods have discussed these problems and in most cases, they are not avoidable and that some methods work better on certain speeds of the drives. This paper presents the Direct Flux Control method to combat the above problems at all speeds. The flux linkage signal which contains the necessary information about the rotor position, can be measured between the neutral point of a permanent magnet synchronous machine and an artificial one. The mathematical derivation and the observations from the experiments show that this signal contains a second and a forth harmonic, which can be used to calculate the rotor position. Furthermore, the limitations of implementing Direct Flux Control are also addressed."},

This paper proposes a detection system based on extracting histogram features. The features are extracted by exploiting the histogram of difference image, which is usually a generalised Gaussian distribution centred at 0. The histogram of difference image and the renormal- ized histogram are created for clean and stego images, therefore using the peak value and renormalized histogram as features for classification. To obtain the difference between neighbouring pixels, the difference images are computed for four directions (vertical, hor- izontal, diagonal, and anti-diagonal). The renormalized histogram of the difference im- age is created a number of times (n) for the four directions. This work implements two commonly-used steganography methods: the Least Significant Bit (LSB) and F5 al- gorithm to create a large database of stego images for system evaluation. Colour and grey images with different formats are chosen for training and testing the system. These formats are lossless and lossy compressions, with all features extracted from each colour channel (RGB) separately. The size of hidden files plays an important role in terms of detection. Therefore, to improve the proposed systems detection capacity, different sizes of hidden files have been considered. The proposed detection system was trained and tested to distinguish stego images from clean ones using the Discriminant Analysis (DA) classification method and Multilayer Perceptron neural network (MLP). The ex- perimental results prove that the proposed system possesses reliable detection ability and accuracy. The chosen classification methods show dissimilar performance in terms of classifying grey and colour images. The system holds more generalisability than previous systems by covering different types of stego images, image formats and hidden file sizes. In addition, extensive experimental results show that the proposed steganalysis system outperforms some previous detection methods."},

Current code-focused information retrieval systems such as Google Code Search, Codeplex or Koders produce results based on specific keywords. However, these systems do not take into account developers\u2019 context such as development language, technology framework, goal of the project, project complexity and developer\u2019s domain expertise. They also impose additional cognitive burden on users in switching between different interfaces and clicking through to find the relevant code. Hence, they are not used by software developers. In this paper, we discuss how software engineers interact with information and general-purpose information retrieval systems (e.g. Google, Yahoo!) and investigate to what extent domain-specific search and recommendation utilities can be developed in order to support their work-related activities. In order to investigate this, we conducted a user study and found that software engineers followed many identifiable and repeatable work tasks and behaviours. These behaviours can be used to develop implicit relevance feedback-based systems based on the observed retention actions. Moreover, we discuss the implications for the development of task-specific search and collaborative recommendation utilities embedded with the Google standard search engine and Microsoft IntelliSense for retrieval and re-engineering of code. Based on implicit relevance feedback, we have implemented a prototype of the proposed collaborative recommendation system, which was evaluated in a controlled environment simulating the real-world situation of professional software engineers. The evaluation has achieved promising initial results on the precision and recall performance of the system.\n\nPublisher statement: This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Enterprise Information Systems on 9th October 2015, available online: http://www.tandfonline.com/10.1080/17517575.2015.1086494"},

At its early stage this project focuses on the analysis of different design concepts and operation principles of such intra vaginal sensor device. Traditional methods of intra-vaginal pH sampling, which rely on analysis of vaginal secretions or discharge from lateral vaginal walls, are difficult in long-term and often fraught with the potential for errors. Therefore this paper focuses on the analysis of such sensor's shape, form, size and fabric in order to enable precise, continuous acquisition of females' and animals' intra-vaginal pH and temperature at the right place inside the vagina. The aim is to set such operation principles, which will enable convenient collection and analysis of continuous vaginal pH and temperature samples for the purpose of further study. The objective is to achieve at least as accurate results as with the discrete analysis of clinicallyobtained intra-vaginal specimens, if not better. The data obtained with such sensors could enable a development of insemination prediction and gynaecological disorders detection models, which deployed to, for example smartphone devices, will help to attain high conception rate for animals and eventually improve the control of the vaginal health for women.\n\n"},

The working principles of fault current limiter and a three-terminal HVdc system are modeled in detail using PSCAD/EMTDC software. The hybrid operation of the SFCL in the three-terminal HVdc system is tested in this paper for the fault response of the MTdc system. The performances of SFCL under different fault conditions are analyzed. The simulation results show that the fault current is effectively restrained and the SFCL can act as an efficient protective device for VSC-based multiterminal HVdc systems."},

Hence, a hybrid artificial intelligence (AI) controller (HaiC) is designed to supervise the spindle speed cutting profile of machining processes to ensure the desired surface quality of the machined part is achieved. It is comprised of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and fuzzy logic (FL) predictive models, and a proportional-derivative (PD) loop, to promote an efficient control based on the manufacturing requirements. Milling experiments were carried out for data collection for the development of the predictive models. The control part is developed and implemented in a simulation environment, and its performance is assessed through several machining scenarios. The results show that the controller provides high-accuracy spindle speed control for assuring surface quality in milling operations.

In contrast, the specific heat is shown to be self-averaging with a distribution function that tends to a $\\delta$-peak in the thermodynamic limit $L \\to \\infty$. While previously a lack of self-averaging was found for the free energy, we here obtain results for quantities that are directly measurable in simulations, and implications for measurements in the actual lattice system are discussed."},

To achieve high-precision results, we utilize a combination of (i) a parallel version of the multicanonical algorithm and (ii) a hybrid updating scheme combining Metropolis and generalized Wolff cluster moves. These techniques are combined to study for the first time the correlation length of the model, using its scaling in the regime of second-order transitions to illustrate universality through the observed identity of the limiting value of $\\xi/L$ with the exactly known result for the Ising universality class."},

This analysis predicts dimensional reduction,\ni.e., that the critical properties of the random-field Ising model in D dimensions are identical to those of the pure Ising ferromagnet in D \u2212 2 dimensions. It is well known that dimensional reduction is not true in three\ndimensions, thus invalidating the perturbative renormalization group prediction. Here, we report high-precision numerical simulations of the 5D random-field Ising model at zero temperature. We illustrate universality by\ncomparing different probability distributions for the random fields.We compute all the relevant critical exponents\n(including the critical slowing down exponent for the ground-state finding algorithm), as well as several other renormalization-group invariants. The estimated values of the critical exponents of the 5D random-field Ising model are statistically compatible to those of the pure 3D Ising ferromagnet. These results support the restoration of dimensional reduction at D = 5.We thus conclude that the failure of the perturbative renormalization group is a low-dimensional phenomenon.We close our contribution by comparing universal quantities for the random-field problem at dimensions 3 \n2\\leq D < 6 to their values in the pure Ising model at D \u2212 2 dimensions, and we provide a clear verification of the Rushbrooke equality at all studied dimensions."},

Designing an efficient and fast route recovery mechanism scheme without incurring extra overheads or delays to repair the broken link is a desirable goal for any routing protocol. The route recovery algorithm in reactive routing protocols like AODV occurs only after a link failure is detected. However, we propose a new route discovery mechanism called Route Migration over Multiple link failure in Multi-Channel (RMMMC), which combines multiple paths and channels to provide a disjointed alternative route. When link failure is detected, the RMMMC reroutes the data packet through the alternative route in alternative channels that have been previously discovered. Furthermore, the RMMMC is resilient to multiple link failures. Unlike other route recovery approaches, nodes in RMMMC are considered to be equipped with a single transceiver. The RMMMC scheme is implemented and extensively evaluated by using an ns-2 simulator. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a better packet delivery ratio, throughput and reduces the routing overhead and end-to-end delay in a dense network."},

Our communication system comprises a chemoemitter module that encodes information by producing volatile pheromone components and a chemoreceiver module that decodes the transmitted ratiometric information via polymer-coated piezoelectric Surface Acoustic Wave Resonator (SAWR) sensors. The inspiration for such a system is based on the pheromone-based communication between insects. Ten features are extracted from the SAWR sensor response and analysed using multi-variate classification techniques, i.e., Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN), and Multilayer Perception Neural Network (MLPNN) methods, and an optimal feature subset is identified. A combination of steady state and transient features of the sensor signals showed superior performances with LDA and MLPNN. Although MLPNN gave excellent results reaching 100% recognition rate at 400 s, over all time stations PNN gave the best performance based on an expanded data-set with adjacent neighbours. In this case, 100% of the pheromone mixtures were successfully identified just 200 s after they were first injected into the wind tunnel. We believe that this approach can be used for future chemical communication employing simple mixtures of airborne molecules."},

The concept of extending the current practise of incident and investigation record keeping to something akin to an Aeronautical Pilots Logbook: i.e. a record of all matters to do with their flying history. In respect of how that translates in the Digital Investigation realm, a comprehensive record of all elements that might constitute an individual\u2019s record of work and development.  Although the natural environment of debating note taking for digital forensic evidential purposes is legal in nature, the origins of this paper relate less to Law than the processes involved in investigation and are a good deal more fundamental than examining forensic artefacts. They also reflect the concepts of professionalising practise and establishing an understanding of what constitutes evidential sufficiency for the purposes of court proceedings, but how this process can be applied to individual development and progress. By taking the rationale that governs the investigative note taking employed by Senior Investigating Officers (SIOs), investigating the most serious and complex of criminal offences there is an opportunity to enhance current contemporaneous note taking and keeping. The object in so doing is twofold: codify current practices and give them a framework that is consistent and well understood; and secondly, to establish the recorded decision making processes to make the auditing of an investigation a much more transparent, obvious and sequential process. Inevitably, there is a need to consider the legal aspects of how note taking has relevance to proceedings and whilst the paper refers to Association of Chief Officers (ACPO) Principles regarding Digital Evidence, the universal application of these concepts should be understood."},

Population annealing is a sequential Monte Carlo method that simulates an ensemble of system replica under a cooling protocol. The population element makes it naturally well suited for massively parallel simulations, and bias can be systematically reduced by increasing the population size. We present an implementation of population annealing on graphics processing units and discuss its behavior for different systems undergoing continuous and first-order phase transitions."},

Receiver Directed Transmission protocol (RDT) is designed to provide multichannel access using a single radio interface. RDT introduces a clever approach to support channel assignment and negotiation without relying on a control channel or time synchronisation. Protocols based on the RDT scheme normally use an extra radio interface, dual home channel or time synchronisation to overcome the expected issues in RDT, such as, hidden terminal and deafness problems. This paper demonstrates that using RDT with a single radio and single home channel it is still possible to increase the network capacity. Additionally, the paper investigates the effect of node density, mobility and number of available channels on RDT performance. NS-2 simulator is used to evaluate the proposed scheme. Simulation results confirm that using multichannel RDT scheme can effectively increase the throughput, the packet delivery ratio and reduce the delay compared to single channel protocol."},

These applications require a reconfigurable sensor architecture that can span multiple scenarios, devices and use cases that allow storage, networking and computational resources to be efficiently used on the edge of the network. There are a number of platforms and gateway architectures that have been proposed to manage these components and enable application deployment. These approaches lack horizontal integration between multiple providers as well as higher order functionalities like load balancing and clustering. This is partly due to the strongly coupled nature of the deployed applications, a lack of abstraction of device communication layers as well as a lock-in for communication protocols. This limitation is a major obstacle for the development of a protocol agnostic application environment that allows for single application to be migrated and to work with multiple peripheral devices with varying protocols from different local gateways. This research looks at existing platforms and their shortcomings as well as proposes a messaging based modular gateway platform that enables clustering of gateways and the abstraction of peripheral communication protocol details. These novelties allow applications to send and receive messages regardless of their deployment location and destination device protocol, creating a more uniform development environment. Furthermore, it results in a more streamlined application development and testing while providing more efficient use of the gateway\u2019s resources. Our evaluation of a prototype for the system shows the need for the migration of resources and the QoS advantages of such a system. The examined use case scenarios show that clustering proves to be an advantage in certain use cases as well as presenting the deployment of a larger testing and control environment through the platform."},

To ensure in-time reaction for intelligent surveillance, it is a fundamental task for real-world applications to determine the gender of people of interest. However, normal video algorithms for gender profiling (usually face profiling) have three drawbacks. First, the profiling result is always uncertain. Second, the profiling result is not stable. The degree of certainty usually varies over time, sometimes even to the extent that a male is classified as a female, and vice versa. Third, for a robust profiling result in cases that a person\u2019s face is not visible, other features, such as body shape, are required. These algorithms may provide different recognition results - at the very least, they will provide different degrees of certainties. To overcome these problems, in this paper, we introduce an Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidential approach that makes use of profiling results from multiple algorithms over a period of time, in particular, Denoeux\u2019s cautious rule is applied for fusing mass functions through time lines. Experiments show that this approach does provide better results than single profiling results and classic fusion results. Furthermore, it is found that if severe mis-classification has occurred at the beginning of the time line, the combination can yield undesirable results. To remedy this weakness, we further propose three extensions to the evidential approach proposed above incorporating notions of time-window, time-attenuation, and time-discounting, respectively. These extensions also applies Denoeux\u2019s rule along with time lines and take the DS approach as a special case. Experiments show that these three extensions do provide better results than their predecessor when mis-classifications occur."},

The poems, which purported to have been composed by a third-century bard named Ossian, quickly achieved wide international acclaim. They invited comparisons with major works of the epic tradition, including Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and effected a profound influence on the emergent Romantic period in literature and the arts. However, the work also provoked one of the most famous literary controversies of all time, colouring the reception of the poetry to this day. The authenticity of the poems was questioned by some scholars, while others protested that they misappropriated material from Irish mythological sources. Recent years have seen a growing critical interest in Ossian, initiated by revisionist and counter-revisionist scholarship and by the two-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the first collected edition of the poems in 1765. Here we investigate Ossian from a networks-science point of view. We compare the connectivity structures underlying the societies described in the Ossianic narratives with those of ancient Greek and Irish sources. Despite attempts, from the outset, to position Ossian alongside the Homeric epics and to distance it from Irish sources, our results indicate significant network-structural differences between Macpherson's text and those of Homer. They also show a strong similarity between Ossianic networks and those of the narratives known as Acallam na Sen\\'orach (Colloquy of the Ancients) from the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology."},

In this paper, we have proposed an integrated approach for biometric-based image retrieval and processing which addresses the two issues. The first issue is related to the poor visibility of the images produced by the embedded and distributed surveillance cameras, and the second issue is concerned with the effective image retrieval based on the user query. This paper addresses the first issue by proposing an integrated image enhancement approach based on contrast enhancement and colour balancing methods. The contrast enhancement method is used to improve the contrast, while the colour balancing method helps to achieve a balanced colour. Importantly, in the colour balancing method, a new process for colour cast adjustment is introduced which relies on statistical calculation. It adjusts the colour cast and maintains the luminance of the image. The integrated image enhancement approach is applied to the enhancement of low quality images produced by surveillance cameras. The paper addresses the second issue relating to image retrieval by proposing a content-based image retrieval approach. The approach is based on the three features extraction methods namely colour, texture and shape. Colour histogram is used to extract the colour features of an image. Gabor filter is used to extract the texture features and the moment invariant is used to extract the shape features of an image. The use of these three algorithms ensures that the proposed image retrieval approach produces results which are highly relevant to the content of an image query, by taking into account the three distinct features of the image and the similarity metrics based on Euclidean measure. In order to retrieve the most relevant images, the proposed approach also employs a set of fuzzy heuristics to improve the quality of the results further. The results show the proposed approaches perform better than the well-known existing approaches."},

This growing interest is motivated by its pedagogical effectiveness and the fact that, in labour contexts, enterprises organize their employees in teams to carry out complex projects. Despite its crucial importance in the classroom and industry, there is a lack of support for the team formation process. Not only do many factors influence team performance, but the problem becomes exponentially costly if teams are to be optimized. In this article, we propose a tool whose aim it is to cover such a gap. It combines artificial intelligence techniques such as coalition structure generation, Bayesian learning, and Belbin\u2019s role theory to facilitate the generation of working groups in an educational context. This tool improves current state of the art proposals in three ways: i) it takes into account the feedback of other teammates in order to establish the most predominant role of a student instead of self-perception questionnaires; ii) it handles uncertainty with regard to each student\u2019s predominant team role; iii) it is iterative since it considers information from several interactions in order to improve the estimation of role assignments. We tested the performance of the proposed tool in an experiment involving students that took part in three different team activities. The experiments suggest that the proposed tool is able to improve different teamwork aspects such as team dynamics and student satisfaction."},

The interest in conflict resolution lies in diverse reasons. One of the main reasons is that computational systems have gradually shifted towards a distributed paradigm where heterogeneous entities should include computational conflict resolution mechanisms, such as proposed by agreement technologies. This chapter gives an overview of these technologies, which are needed in order to ensure the accomplishment of the global system goal and to solve conflicts. Among agreement technologies, automated negotiation is proposed as one key mechanism in conflict resolution due to its analogous use in human conflict resolution. Automated negotiation consists of an automated exchange of proposals carried out by software agents on behalf of their users. Another key technology is argumentation, which provides a fruitful means of dealing with conflicts and knowledge inconsistencies. Agents can reach agreements by engaging in argumentation dialogues with their opponents in a discussion."},

This paper provides a critical analysis of the air pollution trend in the city over the period 2006-2013 at six specific locations where measurements have been consistently recorded. It also discusses the potential health implications pertaining to exceeding levels of pollutants where these are applicable. In order to attain informed decisions on the protection of the health of populations from elevated levels of air pollution, an understanding of spatial-temporal variance of air pollutant patterns is necessary. The study highlights the fact that Bangalore and other similar developing cities do not have an adequate number of fixed monitoring stations that could provide a complete coverage of the air pollution levels for the entire city. It is suggested that this can be overcome by using geospatial interpolation techniques that provide a complete coverage of the levels of pollutants, as well as assist in mapping health characteristics of the population, in order to reach evidence-based decisions and target effective interventions."},

In this paper, we propose a space-time random access method based on a directional data transmission strategy, by which collisions in the wireless channel are significantly decreased and channel utility efficiency is greatly enhanced. Simulation results show that our proposed method can decrease the packet loss rate to less than 2% in large scale WSNs and in comparison with other channel access schemes for WSNs, the average network throughput can be doubled.\n\n"},

However, existing trademark/logo retrieval techniques and content-based image retrieval methods are mostly designed for generic images, which cannot provide effective retrieval of trademarks/logos. Although color and spatial features have been intensively investigated for logo image retrieval, in most cases they were applied separately. When these are combined in a fused manner, a fixed weighting is normally used between them which cannot reflect the significance of these features in the images. When the image quality is degraded by various reasons such as noise, the reliability of color and spatial features may change in different ways, such that the weights between them should be adapted to such changes. In this paper, adaptive fusion of color and spatial descriptors is proposed for colored logo/trademark image retrieval. First, color quantization and k-means are combined for effective dominant color extraction. For each extracted dominant color, a component-based spatial descriptor is derived for local features. By analyzing the image histogram, an adaptive fusion of these two features is achieved for more effective logo abstraction and more accurate image retrieval. The proposed approach has been tested on a database containing over 2300 logo/trademark images. Experimental results have shown that the proposed methodology yields improved retrieval precision and outperforms three state-of-the-art techniques even with added Gaussian, salt and pepper, and speckle noise."},

It determines, often to a large extent, the amount of research funding flowing into universities and similar institutes from governmental agencies and it impacts upon academic careers. Policy makers are becoming increasingly reliant upon, and influenced by, the outcomes of such evaluations. In response, university managers are increasingly attracted to simple metrics as guides to the dynamics of the positions of their various institutions in league tables. However, these league tables are invariably drawn up by inexpert bodies such as newspapers and magazines, using arbitrary measures and criteria. Terms such as \"critical mass\" and \"h-index\" are bandied about without understanding of what they actually mean. Rather than accepting the rise and fall of universities, departments and individuals on a turbulent sea of arbitrary measures, we suggest it is incumbent upon the scientific community itself to clarify their nature. Here we report on recent attempts to do that by properly defining critical mass and showing how group size influences research quality. We also examine currently predominant metrics and show that these fail as reliable indicators of group research quality.\n\n"},

One possibility is to precondition the input polynomials using Groebner Basis (GB) theory. Previous experiments have shown that while this can often be very beneficial to the CAD algorithm, for some problems it can significantly worsen the CAD performance. In the present paper we investigate whether machine learning, specifically a support vector machine (SVM), may be used to identify those CAD problems which benefit from GB preconditioning. We run experiments with over 1000 problems (many times larger than previous studies) and find that the machine learned choice does better than the human-made heuristic.\n\n"},

Even though there is a lack of standard methodologies or formulaic frameworks to better inform game-based intervention development, there exist scientific and empirical studies that can serve as benchmarks for establishing scientific validity in terms of the efficacy of using games to achieve serious outcomes. The development of these games does not normally follow a specific set of guidelines, which limits replication. There is a need to reflect on such a multidisciplinary process and infuse knowledge from relevant disciplines towards developing a unity of considerations and approaches beyond the disciplinary perspectives. An infused and trans-disciplinary methodological framework could serve as a guideline to inform the development process of a game-based approach. With these perspectives, this paper aims to provide an example of how relevant theories and frameworks can be adopted collectively in order to inform a development process. Based on a digital game intervention aiming to support the delivery of Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) in the UK, this paper reflects on trans-disciplinary considerations, informed by frameworks such as the Four-Dimensional Framework (4DF), the Intervention Mapping (IM) approach, Mechanics Dynamics Aesthetics model (MDA) and Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) mapping. IM, when infused with the game design considerations of 4DF, provides a more procedural perspective to game-based intervention development, collectively reflecting a participatory development approach. This subsequently provides the basis upon which other theoretical and methodological frameworks such as the MDA and the LM-GM models can be embedded in order to marry the pedagogical aspects with the entertainment attributes of gameplay. These components, when integrated, may formulate a trans-disciplinary model that can be adopted and adapted by other researchers, designers and developers."},

For a chain of finite length, we obtained the exact monomer density distributions across the layers at different temperatures. The change in density profile with shear stress suggests that the polymer under shear flow can be used as a molecular gate with potential application as a sensor."},

Argyriou, D. Makris", "author link": null, "abstract": "Recognising human actions in real-time can provide users with a natural user interface (NUI) enabling a range of innovative and immersive applications. A NUI application should not restrict users\u2019 movements; it should allow users to transition between actions in quick succession, which we term as compound actions. However, the majority of action recognition researchers have focused on individual actions, so their approaches are limited to recognising single actions or multiple actions that are temporally separated.\n\nThis paper proposes a novel online action recognition method for fast detection of compound actions. A key contribution is our hierarchical body model that can be automatically configured to detect actions based on the low level body parts that are the most discriminative for a particular action. Another key contribution is a transfer learning strategy to allow the tasks of action segmentation and whole body modelling to be performed on a related but simpler dataset, combined with automatic hierarchical body model adaption on a more complex target dataset.\n\nExperimental results on a challenging and realistic dataset show an improvement in action recognition performance of 16% due to the introduction of our hierarchical transfer learning. The proposed algorithm is fast with an average latency of just 2 frames (66 ms) and outperforms state of the art action recognition algorithms that are capable of fast online action recognition.\n\n"},

Borovsky, ", "author link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/martin-weigel", "abstract": "The population annealing algorithm is a novel approach to study systems with rough free-energy landscapes, such as spin glasses. It combines the power of simulated annealing, Boltzmann weighted differential reproduction and sequential Monte Carlo process to bring the population of replicas to the equilibrium even in the low-temperature region. Moreover, it provides a very good estimate of the free energy. The fact that population annealing algorithm is performed over a large number of replicas with many spin updates, makes it a good candidate for massive parallelism. We chose the GPU programming using a CUDA implementation to create a highly optimized simulation. It has been previously shown for the frustrated Ising antiferromagnet on the stacked triangular lattice with a ferromagnetic interlayer coupling, that standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations fail to equilibrate at low temperatures due to the effect of kinetic freezing of the ferromagnetically ordered chains. We applied the population annealing to study the case with the isotropic intra- and interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling (J2/|J1| = \u22121). The reached ground states correspond to non-magnetic degenerate states, where chains are antiferromagnetically ordered, but there is no long-range ordering between them, which is analogical with Wannier phase of the 2D triangular Ising antiferromagnet.\n\n"},

Applying principal component analysis, change-point analysis and a sequential t-test analysis of regime shifts to 72 time series, we confirm that the 1980s regime shift represented a major change in the Earth's biophysical systems from the upper atmosphere to the depths of the ocean and from the Arctic to the Antarctic, and occurred at slightly different times around the world. Using historical climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and statistical modelling of historical temperatures, we then demonstrate that this event was triggered by rapid global warming from anthropogenic plus natural forcing, the latter associated with the recovery from the El Chich\u00f3n volcanic eruption. The shift in temperature that occurred at this time is hypothesized as the main forcing for a cascade of abrupt environmental changes. Within the context of the last century or more, the 1980s event was unique in terms of its global scope and scale; our observed consequences imply that if unavoidable natural events such as major volcanic eruptions interact with anthropogenic warming unforeseen multiplier effects may occur.\n\n"},

The influences of the air inlet temperatures and velocities have been investigated on the charging/discharging time of the PCM panels, heating/cooling load and effectiveness over the phase transition. These parameters play a vital on determining thermal performance of an air-PCM unit. Air inlet temperatures of 34 \u00b0C, 36 \u00b0C and 38 \u00b0C and air inlet velocities of 0.6 m/s, 1.6 m/s and 2.5 m/s. have been studied. The increase of the air inlet velocity reduced the charging and discharging time, however not linearly. The time for the complete melting and solidification is substantially reduced when the velocity has been increased from 0.6 m/s to 1.6 m/s. The air inlet temperature has been proved to be most important factor affecting the discharging time. For lower air inlet velocity the cooling and heating loads achieve lower values but remain nearly constant over a longer period of time. The effectiveness reaches its highest values for the air inlet velocity of 0.6 m/s for the charging and discharging processes. It has been concluded that discharging time can be extended by reducing the air inlet velocity and making the technology more suitable for heating and cooling applications for the buildings. A simplified methodology is proposed for the analysis of the PCM charging and discharging process through the identification of the critical points as result of the heat transfer behaviour in the air- PCM unit."},

Zang, R. Helm, Tim Sparks, A.

We used spring phenology of common wild plants in a phenology-based forecasting approach for European spruce bark beetle Ips typographicus L. early flight activity in Bavaria, Southern Germany, and tested this novel approach against traditional thermal sum-based predictions. Our phenology-based forecast employing the 2 phenological phases of first flowering of common snowdrop Galanthus nivalis L. and leaf budburst of horse chestnut Aesculus hippocastanum L. proved to be more robust and accurate than the thermal sum-based forecast. This is explained by both bark beetle phenology and plant phenology being results of a complex control chain of environmental factors, which can be approximated by temperature sums only to a limited degree. However, our space-for-time approach demonstrates strong and unequivocal temperature sensitivity of bark beetle and plant phenology. This indicates a common pattern in bioclimatic mediation of ecophysiological processes for both plants and insects as the mechanistic foundation for forecasting. In the case of costly bark beetle activity monitoring data often characterised by gaps and irregular sampling intervals, plant phenology can thus provide an easily observable alternative or complementary predictor for early flight activity. Our results indicate that forest practitioners can benefit from simple phenological observations to improve the timing of adequate management measures to mitigate bark beetle mass infestations.\n\n"},

Their effectiveness can further be increased for building heating/cooling applications if used along with energy storage.

Several studies have been made on improving the heat transfer by using thermal conductivity enhancers (TCEs). However, no study provides comprehensive analysis on their complex and non-stationary heat transfer characteristics. This paper focuses on the influences of thermal conductivity enhancers (TCEs) on heat transfer performance inside the phase change material (PCM) during the melting and solidification processes for solar chimney application. Four types of TCEs namely vertical fin (VF), horizontal fin (HF), honeycomb structure (HCS) and square cell structure (SCS) have been used in the study. The experimental results show that the VF, HF, HCS and SCS reduces the melting time by 8%, 12%, 14.5% and 16%, respectively compared to the pure PCM sample. It is also being found that the VF and HF with the same volume fraction have different effects on the heat transfer inside the PCM during the melting process proving that the geometry and distribution of fins are very important for the heat transfer enhancement."},

Current challenges in studying hedges\nrelate to the dominance of research on rural, as opposed to urban, hedges, and their variability and geographical\nbreadth. To help address these challenges and to educate the public on the importance of hedge habitats for wildlife,\nin 2010 the Open Air Laboratories (OPAL) programme coordinated a hedge-focused citizen science survey.\nResults: Results from 2891 surveys were analysed. Woody plant species differed significantly between urban and\nrural areas. Beech, Holly, Ivy, Laurel, Privet and Yew were more commonly recorded in urban hedges whereas Blackthorn,\nBramble, Dog Rose, Elder and Hawthorn were recorded more often in rural hedges. Urban and rural differences\nwere shown for some groups of invertebrates. Ants, earwigs and shieldbugs were recorded more frequently in urban\nhedges whereas blowflies, caterpillars, harvestmen, other beetles, spiders and weevils were recorded more frequently\nin rural hedges. Spiders were the most frequently recorded invertebrate across all surveys. The presence of hard\nsurfaces adjacent to the hedge was influential on hedge structure, number and diversity of plant species, amount of\nfood available for wildlife and invertebrate number and diversity. In urban hedges with one adjacent hard surface,\nthe food available for wildlife was significantly reduced and in rural hedges, one adjacent hard surface affected the\ndiversity of invertebrates.\nConclusions: This research highlights that urban hedges may be important habitats for wildlife and that hard surfaces\nmay have an impact on both the number and diversity of plant species and the number and diversity of invertebrates.\nThis study demonstrates that citizen science programmes that focus on hedge surveillance can work and have\nthe added benefit of educating the public on the importance of hedgerow habitats.\n\n"},

We study numerically the density of bridges and the fragmentation kernel, i.e., the relative sizes of the generated fragments, and find that these quantities follow a scaling description. The corresponding scaling exponents are related to well known equilibrium critical exponents of the model. Using the Russo-Margulis formalism, we derive an exact relation between the expected density of bridges and the number of active edges. The same approach allows us to study the fluctuations in the numbers of bridges, thereby uncovering a new singularity in the random- cluster model as q <4 cos2 (\u03c0/\u221a3) in two dimensions. For numerical simulations of the model directly in the language of individual bonds, known as Sweeny's algorithm, the prevalence of bridges and the scaling of the sizes of clusters connected by bridges and candidate-bridges play a pivotal role. We discuss several different implementations of the necessary connectivity algorithms and assess their relative performance.\n\n"},

In order to develop a predictive model for health-shocks, we have collected a unique data from 1000 households, in rural and remotely accessible regions of Pakistan, focusing on factors like health, social, economic, environment and accessibility to healthcare facilities. We have used the collected data to generate a predictive model of health-shock using a fuzzy rule summarization technique, which can provide stakeholders with interpretable linguistic rules to explain the causal factors affecting health-shocks. The evaluation of the proposed system in terms of the interpret-ability and accuracy of the generated data models for classifying health-shock shows promising results. The prediction accuracy of the fuzzy model based on a k-fold cross-validation of the data samples shows above 89% performance in predicting health-shocks based on the given factors.\n\n"},

Low", "author link": null, "abstract": "The determination of the contact points between two bodies with analytically described boundaries can be viewed as the limiting case of the extremal point problem, where the distance between the bodies is vanishing. The advantage of this approach is that the solutions can be computed efficiently along with the generalized state during time integration of a multibody system by augmenting the equations of motion with the corresponding extremal point conditions. Unfortunately, these solutions can degenerate when one boundary is concave or both boundaries are nonconvex. We present a novel method to derive degeneracy and nondegeneracy conditions that enable the determination of the type and codimension of all the degenerate solutions that can occur in plane contact problems involving two bodies with smooth boundaries. It is shown that only divergence bifurcations are relevant, and thus, we can simplify the analysis of the degeneracy by restricting the system to its one-dimensional center manifold. The resulting expressions are then decomposed by applying the multinomial theorem resulting in a computationally efficient method to compute explicit expressions for the Lyapunov coefficients and transversality conditions. Furthermore, a procedure to analyze the bifurcation behavior qualitatively at such solution points based on the Tschirnhaus transformation is given and demonstrated by examples. The application of these results enables in principle the continuation of all the solutions simultaneously beyond the degeneracy as long as their number is finite."},

However, understanding the impacts of spatial variability in ET and the appropriate scale at which ET data should be incorporated into hydrological models, particularly at the regional scale, is often overlooked. This is in contrast to dealing with the spatial variability in rainfall data where existing guidance is widely available. This paper assesses the impacts of scale on the estimation of reference ET (ETo) by comparing data from individual weather stations against values derived from three national datasets, at varying resolutions. These include the UK Climate Impacts Programme 50 km climatology (UKCP50), the UK Met Office 5 km climatology (UKMO5) and the regional values published in the Agricultural Climate of England and Wales (ACEW). The national datasets were compared against the individual weather station data and the UKMO5 was shown to provide the best estimate of ETo at a given site. The potential impacts on catchment modelling were then considered by mapping variance in ETo to show how geographical location and catchment size can have a major impact, with small lowland catchments having much higher variance than those with much larger areas or in the uplands. Some important implications for catchment hydrological modelling are highlighted."},

A comprehensive literature search is performed using keywords\u2019 laparoscopic robot, capsule endoscope, surgical medical robot etc. primarily for the time period of 2000\u20132015. The articles relevant to the theme of the paper are reviewed and included in the paper. This paper concentrates medical robots for minimally invasive diagnosis and intervention in general and propulsions of miniature robots in particular. Robots are classified and compared using critical characteristics and summarized in Tables 1\u20136. Large robots such as da-Vinci are successfully used in many procedures e.g. neurosurgery, cardiothoracic surgery etc. However there are needs for more functionality which might lead to flexible robots. For miniature robots, each propulsion mechanism has some advantages and disadvantages. While external magnetic propulsions have potential to provide propulsion without increasing the robot size, they lack precise position control and may require expensive and bulky equipment. On the other hand internal propulsions have the capability of precise position control but require mechanisms which need substantial amount of power to drive. Hybrid propulsion which combines best features of both internal and external propulsions could be a solution for this. Robots have improved the healthcare services for many medical procedures. However, still there are challenges to address to enable use of medical robots universally inside and outside hospitals for diagnosis and interventions."},

AODV is a reactive MANET routing protocol that is vulnerable to a dramatic collapse of network performance in the presence of blackhole attack. The paper introduces a new concept of Self-Protocol Trustiness (SPT) in which detecting a malicious intruder is accomplished by complying with the normal protocol behavior and lures the malicious node to give an implicit avowal of its malicious behavior. We present a Blackhole Resisting Mechanism (BRM) to resist such attacks that can be incorporated into any reactive routing protocol. It does not require expensive cryptography or authentication mechanisms, but relies on locally applied timers and thresholds to classify nodes as malicious. No modifications to the packet formats are needed, so the overhead is a small amount of calculation at nodes, and no extra communication. Using NS2 simulation, we compare the performance of networks using AODV under blackhole attacks with and without our mechanism to SAODV, showing that it significantly reduces the effect of a blackhole attack."},

As such, there should be no remaining doubt regarding its validity. However, finite-size scaling, which derives from it, has long been poorly understood above the upper critical dimension dc in models with free boundary conditions. In addition to its fundamental significance for scaling theories, the issue is important at a practical level because finite-size, statistical-physics systems with free boundaries and above dc are experimentally relevant for long-range interactions. Here, we address the roles played by Fourier modes for such systems and show that the current phenomenological picture is not supported for all thermodynamic observables with either free or periodic boundaries. In particular, the expectation that dangerous irrelevant variables cause Gaussian-fixed-point scaling indices to be replaced by Landau mean-field exponents for all Fourier modes is incorrect. Instead, the Gaussian-fixed-point exponents have a direct physical manifestation for some modes above the upper critical dimension."},

Recent experimental developments aimed at interrogating anew the low-temperature properties of these systems, in particular whether the predicted transition to long-range order occurs, behoove researchers to scrutinize our current dipolar spin ice model description of these materials. In this work, we do so by combining extensive Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field theory calculations to analyze data from previous magnetization, diffuse neutron scattering, and specific-heat measurements on the paradigmatic Dy2Ti2O7 spin ice material. In this work, we also reconsider the possible importance of the nuclear specific heat Cnuc in Dy2Ti2O7. We find that Cnuc is not entirely negligible below a temperature \u223c0.5 K and must therefore be taken into account in a quantitative analysis of the calorimetric data of this compound below that temperature. We find that in this material, small effective spin-spin exchange interactions compete with the magnetostatic dipolar interaction responsible for the main spin ice phenomenology. This causes an unexpected \u201crefrustration\u201d of the long-range order that would be expected from the incompletely self-screened dipolar interaction and which positions the material at the boundary between two competing classical long-range-ordered ground states. This allows for the manifestation of new physical low-temperature phenomena in Dy2Ti2O7, as exposed by recent specific-heat measurements. We show that among the four most likely causes for the observed upturn of the specific heat at low temperature [an exchange-induced transition to long-range order, quantum non-Ising (transverse) terms in the effective spin Hamiltonian, the nuclear hyperfine contribution, and random disorder], only the last appears to be reasonably able to explain the calorimetric data."},

Particles are detected by the frequency shift caused by the mass of particles present on one resonator with while the other acts as a reference channel. Experimental validation of the system was performed inside an environmental chamber using a dust generator with the particles of known size and concentration. A sensor sensitivity of 4.6 Hz per \u03bcg/m3 was demonstrated for the SMRs resonating at a frequency of 970 MHz.

A study of over 10% of all children on child protection plans or who were looked after in out-of-home care in England in March 2012 is reported. Children from ethnic minority categories were much more likely than \u2018White\u2019 children to be living in disadvantaged areas and this has to be taken into account when examining intervention rates. Controlling for deprivation and examining small sub-groups of the broad ethnic categories radically alters the simple understanding that \u2018Black\u2019 children are over-represented compared to White amongst children in out-of-home care, while \u2018Asian\u2019 children are under-represented.

Previous studies have focused on examining the technique of free-throw shooting (Goosey-Tolfrey, Butterworth, & Morriss, 2002, Adapted Physical Activity Quarterly, 19, 238\u2013250); however, free-throws only equate to approximately 15\u201322% of the total number of shots taken during a game (G\u00f3mez, P\u00e9rez, Molik, Szyman, & Sampaio, 2014, Journal of Sports Sciences, 32 (11), 1066\u20131075). To date, no attempts have been made to explore the determinants of two-point and three-point shooting. This study explores the key determinants of two-point and threepoint shooting and develops a valid prediction model. Following ethical approval, footage of all of the twopoint and three-point shots taken when the top five teams played each other (nine games; 1144 shots) at the 2015 Men\u2019s European Wheelchair Basketball Championships was analysed in SportsCode (version 10, SportsTec Ltd). A valid and reliable shooting specific performance analysis template was developed by three elite wheelchair basketball coaches and the lead researcher (Inter-operator reliability \u00b1 1: 0.00%; Intraoperator reliability \u00b1 1: 0.00%). The template contained 61 action variables within 20 categories: Point, Quarter, Match Status, Classification, Shot Hand, Shot Handed, Shot Type, Shot Clock, Pre-Shot, Shot Movement, Shot Positioning, Zone, Pressure, Number of Defenders, Defender Marking-Shooting Hand, Defender Marking-Non-Shooting Hand, Defender Marking-Space and Defenders Positioning-Defender In Front, Defenders Positioning-Defender Behind and Defenders Positioning-Defender on Side. Chi-squared test highlighted seven categories were significant (P < 0.001) when shot outcome was compared (successful versus unsuccessful). The Shot Positioning category was the most significant category and produced a P-value of 2.2e-16. The forward selection method was used and a 30% sample of the data set selected to create a shooting specific generalised linear regression model that involved 10 categories. The model was tested against the entire data set and an area under the curve value of 0.850 was achieved. The model demonstrated that when an athlete was able to \u201ccatch and shoot\u201d in a \u201csquare to basket\u201d position whilst \u201cstationary\u201d and taking a \u201cset shot\u201d from the \u201ctwo-point centre long\u201d zone whilst a defender is placing \u201cno pressure\u201d on the shooter the individual achieved a 96.87% success rate.

To address this problem, we first investigate the classic tax evasion cases, and employ a graph-based method to characterize their property that describes two suspicious relationship trails with a same antecedent node behind an Interest-Affiliated Transaction (IAT). Next, we propose a Colored Network-Based Model (CNBM) for characterizing economic behaviors, social relationships, and the IATs between taxpayers, and generating a Taxpayer Interest Interacted Network (TPIIN). To accomplish the tax evasion detection task by discovering suspicious groups in a TPIIN, methods for building a patterns tree and matching component patterns are introduced and the completeness of the methods based on graph theory is presented. Then, we describe an experiment based on real data and a simulated network. The experimental results show that our proposed method greatly improves the efficiency of tax evasion detection, as well as provides a clear explanation of the tax evasion behaviors of taxpayer groups."},

The larger capacitance effect of HVAC submarine cables will cause more severe transient problems. Also, the variable wind power generated by offshore wind farm will bring undesired impact on the onshore power grid.

This is achieved by assigning an exploration cost function that indirectly attracts the robot close to target. Upon discovery of the target, the robot moves to it following the shortest-distance path. Simulation studies that prove the efficiency of the overall method are presented."},

The main idea is to take advantage of the fact that such structures are dissipative and that their presence should reduce the number of degrees of freedom of the flow, when paradoxically, their fine resolution incurs extra computational cost in most current methods. The principle of this method is to use a functional basis with elements that already include these fine structures so as to avoid these extra costs. This leads us to develop an algorithm to implement a spectral method for arbitrary functional bases, and in particular, non-orthogonal ones. We construct a basic implementation of this algorithm to simulate Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channel flows with an externally imposed, transverse magnetic field, where very thin boundary layers are known to develop along the channel walls. In this case, the sought functional basis can be built out of the eigenfunctions of the dissipation operator, which incorporate these boundary layers, and it turns out to be non-orthogonal. We validate this new scheme against numerical simulations of freely decaying MHD turbulence based on a finite volume code and it is found to provide accurate results. Its ability to fully resolve wall-bounded turbulence with a number of modes close to that required by the dynamics is demonstrated on a simple example. This opens the way to full blown simulations of MHD turbulence under very high magnetic fields. Until now such simulations were too computationally expensive. In contrast to traditional methods the computational cost of the proposed method, does not depend on the intensity of the magnetic field.\n\nPublisher statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in the Journal of Computational Physics .

We assume that the order of agenda (issues) has impact on the negotiation outcome, but a group of service consumers and providers may have conflicting preferences over the importance of issues. In a multiple-issue negotiation process it is difficult to reach an optimal outcome when their preferences and the relative importance of their associated issues are not known to each other. The proposed agenda based preference ordering approach helps consumers and providers to reach a consensus over the issues and to construct a common preference sequence to improve the efficiency of the issue-by-issue negotiation outcome. Consequently, a co-evolutionary negotiation model based on the result of preference ordering approach is introduced for the agents to negotiate and reach an agreement, if there is any. The contribution of the research is a new mechanism that is able to formulate issue sequence along with a co-evolutionary negotiation approach that can effectively facilitate negotiation over QoS issues in cloud computing.

However, unlike relational databases, the semantic graph model lacks restrictive structure. Instead, the semantic data rely on an evolving schema. This resulted in a challenge for views materialisation while allowing for open repositories of data to emerge. Open repositories combine knowledge from many different areas. Therefore, it can be assumed that various data structures within a repository may exhibit different daily access patterns, i.e. That the user interests change during the day. This research verifies this assumption and proposes a new views selection model. By analysing how access patterns of individual views contribute to the overall system workload, the proposed model aims at selection of candidates offering the highest reduction of the peak workload. The proposed selection method has been integrated as a part of a new optimisation framework, which operates as a proxy for a SPARQL-enabled database. The approach has a potential to accelerate the adaptation of views materialisation for SPARQL. The proposed approach is evaluated both experimentally and using qualitative analysis."},

Chao", "author link": null, "abstract": "Numerous security concerns exist in smart home systems in which Internet of Things devices are connected through a home network to enable control using a centralised gateway with a handset device from the Internet. Safeguarding personal information privacy is an increasing concern in smart living services. To guarantee the mobile security of smart living services, security managers use taint checking approaches with dynamic taint propagation analysis operations to examine how a software-defined networking app uses sensitive information and investigate suspicious security vulnerabilities of devices and the effects of the spread of taint propagation over the Internet by identifying taint paths. For solving the dynamic taint propagation analysis problem, most approaches focus on cloud computing applications (apps) with malware threat analysis that involves program vulnerability analyses, rather than on the risk posed by suspicious apps connected to the cloud computing server. Accordingly, this article proposes a taint propagation analysis model incorporating a weighted spanning tree analysis scheme for tracking data with taint marking using several taint checking tools with an open software-defined networking architecture for solving the dynamic taint propagation analysis problem. In the proposed model, Android programs perform dynamic taint propagation to analyse the spread of risks posed by suspicious apps connected to the centralised gateway in a smart home system. In probabilistic risk analysis, risk and defence capability are used for each taint path to assist a defender in recognising the attack results against network threats caused by malware infection and to estimate the losses of associated taint sources. A case of threat analysis of a typical cyber security attack is presented to demonstrate the proposed approach. A new approach was used for verifying the details of an attack sequence for malware infection by incorporating a finite state machine to appropriately represent the real dynamic taint propagation analysis situations at various configuration settings and safeguard deployment. The experimental results proved that the threat analysis model enables a defender to convert the spread of taint propagation to loss and estimate the risk of a specific threat using behavioural analysis associated with 60 families of real malware. Consequently, our scheme was significantly effective in predicting the risk and loss of tainted data propagation for security concerns in smart home systems when the number of taint paths associated with the propagation rules discovered through taint analysis was increased.\n\n"},

This study aims to converge the pedagogical benefits of role-playing, educational technology and digital games to investigate the effectiveness of using 3d digital roleplaying games (RPGs) in classrooms to improve transferal of theoretical knowledge to practice in design education. Qualitative data were collected from digital media lecturers to identify desirable learning outcomes and describe teaching and learning challenges of digital media courses. Building upon Bloom's taxonomy, feedback from lecturers informed the development of a conceptual framework in the use of digital RPGs as learning tools to achieve learning outcomes for digital media education. A 3d RPG, Virtual Designer, was developed and tested on students from two campuses of a transnational university in Vietnam and Australia. Through Virtual Designer, undergraduate Digital Media students role-played as designer practitioners in a 3d simulated workplace, applying design knowledge into different hypothetical situations. A quasi-experiment was conducted, where students completed design knowledge tests before and after intervention to evaluate students' ability to transfer theoretical knowledge into practice from the use of Virtual Designer as part of their learning journey. Students also completed surveys and participated in focus group sessions to provide input on as well as perceived benefits or drawbacks on how the use of digital RPGs impacted their learning. This paper reports results and findings acquired from the quasi-experiment, in which digital media students completed pre/post-tests before and after playing Virtual Designer in class. Paired-samples t-test was conducted. Results indicated that there are students experience statistically significant performance gains in post-tests after using Virtual Designer as a digital learning tool to reinforce design theory knowledge."},

To address this problem, we propose a distributed multi-wheelchair global harmonic navigation algorithm. The distinguishing features of the proposed navigation algorithm are global search and local conflict resolution abilities. In the proposed algorithm, a travel time prediction method adopts a penalty for potential conflicts based on wheelchairs\u05f3 priority, velocity and distance between the nodes. Moreover, three harmonic rules are proposed for: (1) giving the highest priority to humans, (2) giving the highest priority to wheelchairs, (3) giving flexible priority to wheelchairs. Through extensive quantitative simulations, we explore the performance of wheelchairs in various floor plan topologies and different values for the system parameters, and demonstrate that the properties of crowded indoor environments have important influence on the performance of global navigation, such as service time. The third harmonic rule establishes the trade-off between the performance of humans and robotic wheelchairs. At the same time, physical prototype wheelchairs are implemented and they verify the proposed global harmonic navigation algorithm. Some suggestions for robotic wheelchair designers, building architects and building owners are provided based on the conclusion of the experimental results.\n\n"},

Within the same interval of chain lengths, the asphericity, prolateness and some other shape characteristics of the chain are found to become independent of N. Their mean values are found to agree reasonably well with the respective theoretical results and lattice Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. We found the probability distribution for a wide range of shape characteristics. For the asphericity and prolateness they are quite broad, resembling in form the results of lattice MC simulations.

VMP problem consists of two sub problems: incremental placement (VMiP) problem and consolidated placement (VMcP) problem. The goal of VMcP is to consolidate the VMs to more suitable PMs. The challenge in VMcP problem is how to find optimal solution effectively and efficiently especially when VMcP is a kind of NP-hard problem. In this paper, we present a novel solution to the VMcP problem called VMPMBBO. The proposed VMPMBBO treats VMcP problem as a complex system and utilizes the biogeography-based optimization (BBO) technique to optimize the virtual machine placement that minimizes both the resource wastage and the power consumption at the same time. Extensive experiments have been conducted using synthetic data from related literature and data from two real datasets. First of all, the necessity of VMcP has been proved by experimental results obtained by applying VMPMBBO. Then, the proposed method is compared with two existing multi-objective VMcP optimization algorithms and it is shown that VMPMBBO has better convergence characteristics and is more computationally efficient as well as robust. And then, the issue of parameter setting of the proposed method has been discussed. Finally, adaptability and extensibility of VMPMBBO have also been proved through experimental results. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first approach that applies biogeography-based optimization (BBO) to virtual machine placement."},

The type-2 SOFLC is a hierarchical adaptive fuzzy controller able to generate and modify its rule-base in response to the controller's performance. The type-2 SOFLC uses type-2 fuzzy sets derived from real surgical data capturing patient variability in monitored physiological parameters during anesthetic sedation, which are used to define the footprint of uncertainty (FOU) of the type-2 fuzzy sets. Experimental simulations were carried out to evaluate the performance of the type-2 SOFLCs in their ability to control anesthetic delivery rates for maintaining desired physiological set points for anesthesia (muscle relaxation and blood pressure) under signal and patient noise. Results show that the type-2 SOFLCs can perform well and outperform previous type-1 SOFLC and comparative approaches for anesthesia control producing lower performance errors while using better defined rules in regulating anesthesia set points while handling the control uncertainties. The results are further supported by statistical analysis which also show that zSlices general type-2 SOFLCs are able to outperform interval type-2 SOFLC in terms of their steady state performance.\n\nPublisher statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Applied Soft Computing.

Involving an interrogator conversing with hidden identities, both human and machine, the test strikes at the heart of any questions about the capacity of machines to behave as humans. While this subject area has shifted dramatically in the last few years, this book offers an up-to-date assessment of Turing's Imitation Game, its history, context and implications, all illustrated with practical Turing tests.

Games provide a key medium through which this may be achieved, though limited evidence exists as regards the best techniques, both pedagogical and technological, by which data can be translated to engaging and educational material. In this paper, we describe the approach adopted by a serious game supporting the development of healthy lifestyles amongst adolescents. The game itself places the player as a survivor in a post-apocalyptic scenario, tasked with survival and exploration. Utilising the United States Department of Agriculture's open data on nutritional information, four different mini-games are implemented in the form of two quiz-based approaches, a puzzle, and a system directly connected to wider game mechanics as a \u201ccrafting\u201d system.

The move away from traditional paper-based course materials, registration, admissions and support services to the mobile, always-on and always accessible data has driven demand for information and generated new forms of data observable through consumption behaviours. These changes have led to a plethora of data sets that store learning content and track user behaviours. Most recently, new data analytics approaches are creating new ways of understanding trends and behaviours in students that can be used to improve learning design, strengthen student retention, provide early warning signals concerning individual students and help to personalise the learner's experience. This paper proposes a foundational learning analytics model (LAM) for higher education that focuses on the dynamic interaction of stakeholders with their data supported by visual analytics, such as self-organising maps, to generate conversations, shared inquiry and solution-seeking. The model can be applied for other educational institutions interested in using learning analytics processes to support personalised learning and support services. Further work is testing its efficacy in increasing student retention rates.\n\n"},

Below the upper critical dimension, where the correlation length is proportional to the system length, both finite-size scaling and hyperscaling take conventional forms. Above the upper critical dimension these forms break down and a new scaling scenario appears. Here we investigate this scaling behaviour by simulating one-dimensional Ising ferromagnets with long-range interactions. We show that the correlation length scales as a non-trivial power of the linear system size and investigate the scaling forms. For interactions of sufficiently long range, the disparity between the correlation length and the system length can be made arbitrarily large, while maintaining the new scaling scenarios. We also investigate the behavior of the correlation function above the upper critical dimension and the modifications imposed by the new scaling scenario onto the associated Fisher relation."},

Reframing such variations as an issue of inequity between children and between families opens the way to a new approach to explaining the profound difference in intervention rates between and within countries and administrative districts. Recent accounts of variation have frequently been based on the idea that there is a binary divide between bias and risk (or need). Here we propose seeing supply (bias) and demand (risk) factors as two aspects of a single system, both framed, in part, by social structures. A recent finding from a study of intervention rates in England, the \u2018inverse intervention law\u2019, is used to illustrate the complex ways in which a range of factors interact to produce intervention rates. In turn, this analysis raises profound moral, policy, practice and research questions about current child welfare and child protection services.\n\n"},

Degree correlations also affect the dynamics of processes supported by a network structure, such as the spread of opinions or epidemics. The proper modelling of these systems, i.e., without uncontrolled biases, requires the sampling of networks with a specified set of constraints. We present a solution to the sampling problem when the constraints imposed are the degree correlations. In particular, we develop an efficient and exact method to construct and sample graphs with a specified joint-degree matrix, which is a matrix providing the number of edges between all the sets of nodes of a given degree, for all degrees, thus completely specifying all pairwise degree correlations, and additionally, the degree sequence itself. Our algorithm always produces independent samples without backtracking. The complexity of the graph construction algorithm is O(NM) where N is the number of nodes and M is the number of edges."},

In this paper, we study the performance of both DSR and its flow-state extension routing protocols in the presence of blackhole, grayhole, selfish and flooding attacks. We conclude that the performance of flow-state DSR is better than DSR in the presence of all attacks. Flooding attacks are found to dramatically impact all the standard performance metrics. Blackhole attacks significantly worse the packet delivery ratio in a static network using unmodified DSR. All the attacks greatly increase the end-to-end delay; an effect particularly marked in a static network."},

We show that the dimensionality of the leading order can be fully described using the single parameter l\u03bdz/h, where l\u03bdz represents the distance over which the Lorentz force is able to act before being balanced by viscous dissipation. The base flow happens to introduce inertial recirculations in the meridional plane at the first order, which are shown to follow two radically different mechanisms: inverse Ekman pumping driven by a vertical pressure gradient along the axis of the vortex, or direct Ekman pumping driven by a radial pressure gradient in the Hartmann boundary layers. We demonstrate that when the base flow is quasi-2D, the relative importance of direct and inverse pumping is solely determined by the aspect ratio \u03b7/h, where \u03b7 refers to the width of the vortex. Of the two mechanisms, only inverse pumping appears to act as a significant source of helicity."},

The proposed classifier can properly classify multi-class data with complex and variously shaped decision boundaries among the different classes of faults and the fault-free state, and is robust against noise. This is due mainly to the fact that the classifier is constructed using the fuzzy-neighborhood density based clustering method, which is not sensitive to the geometrical shape of clusters in the feature space.\n\n"},

The model hence can be used as the base for a truly deep reinforcement learning architecture that can be explored in the future. More importantly this work explores the results of mixing conjugate gradient update with gradient update for the mentioned architecture. The reward signal is back propagated from the critic to the actor through conjugate gradient eligibility trace for the second layer combined with gradient eligibility trace for the first layer. We show that this mixture of updates seems to work well for this model. The features layer have been deeply trained by applying a simple PCA on the whole set of images histograms acquired during the first running episode. The model is also able to adapt to a reduced features dimension autonomously.

Unfortunately, gamified training programs currently available for ADHD have been limited in their ability to demonstrate in-game behavior skills that generalize to daily life situations. Therefore, we developed a new serious game (called \u201cPlan-It Commander\u201d) that was specifically designed to promote behavioral learning and promotes strategy use in domains of daily life functioning such as time management, planning/organizing, and prosocial skills that are known to be problematic for children with ADHD. An interdisciplinary team contributed to the development of the game. The game's content and approach are based on psychological principles from the Self-Regulation Model, Social Cognitive Theory, and Learning Theory. In this article, game development and the scientific background of the behavioral approach are described, as well as results of a survey (n\u2009=\u200942) to gather user feedback on the first prototype of the game. The findings suggest that participants were satisfied with this game and provided the basis for further development and research to the game.

Finite element analysis of the acoustic resonators was performed using COMSOL Multiphysics software in order to evaluate the frequency response of the devices and the performance of the acoustic mirror. The zinc oxide based acoustic resonators were fabricated on a silicon substrate using a five mask process.

Engineering resilient system/infrastructure is a challenging task, that implies how to measure the resilience and how to obtain sufficient resilience necessary to maintain its service delivery under diverse situations. This paper has two fold objective, the first is to propose a formal approach to measure cyber resilience from different aspects (i.e., attacks, failures) and at different levels (i.e., pro-active, resistive and reactive). To achieve the first objective, we propose a formal framework named as: Cyber Resilience Engineering Framework (CREF). The second objective is to build a resilient system by construction. The idea is to build a formal model of a cyber system, which is initially not resilient with respect to attacks. Then by systematic refinements of the formal model and by its model checking, we attain resiliency. We exemplify our technique through the case study of simple cyber security device (i.e., network firewall)."},

While students showed much interest in ecological issues there was much lower awareness of impacts of the use of appliances, and no observed energy-saving action by students. Thus, while attitudes supporting behaviour change appear to be in place, this is not yet translating into action. Drawing on Social Practice Theory (SPT, Shove et al, 2012), we propose that this is to do with absence of salience (energy use is not the key focus of student activity), together with absence of licence (students appear not to feel they are permitted).

It is much rarer to see evaluations of population change over the longer\u2013term in order\nto extend the baseline back in time. Here, we use two methods (regression analysis and line of equality) to\nidentify long-term differences in abundance derived from qualitative descriptions, and we test the efficacy of\nthis approach by comparison with contemporary data. We take descriptions of bird population abundance in\nCambridgeshire, UK, from the first half of the 19th century and compare these with more recent estimates by\nconverting qualitative descriptions to an ordinal scale. We show, first, that the ordinal scale of abundance corresponds\nwell to quantitative estimates of density and range size based on current data, and, second, that the\ntwo methods of comparison revealed both increases and declines in species, some of which were consistent\nusing both approaches but others showed differing responses. We also show that the regional rates of extinction\n(extirpation) for birds are twice as high as equivalent rates for plants. These data extend analyses of avifaunal\nchange back to a baseline 160-190 years before present, thus bringing a novel perspective on long-term change\nin populations and categories of conservation concern (e.g., Amber- or Red-lists) based on recent data.

The Priority method is employed to group jobs into four groups, while two different methods, SimilarTogether and EvenlyDistributed, are employed to group machines into four groups before implementing the MinMin Grid scheduling algorithm simultaneously. Implementing the scheduling algorithms simultaneously within paired groups (multi-scheduling) ensures a high degree of parallelism, increases throughput and improves the overall performance of scheduling algorithms. Two sets of controlled experiments were carried out on an HPC system. Analysis of results shows that the Priority Grouping method improved the scheduling efficiency by very large margins over the non-grouping method."},

An interactive learning tool to teach Python programming language to students, called PILeT, has been developed to test the hypothesis. The tool aims to be adaptable to the students' learning style and as such it will teach programming using several techniques (e.g. visual, textual, puzzles) to appeal to each preference.

Kumar, R.S. Bali, Rahat Iqbal, N. Chilamkurti, S. Rho", "author link": null, "abstract": "Vehicular cyber-physical systems (VCPS) have emerged as one of the most powerful technologies for providing cost-effective services to the end users with minimum delay even with high mobility of the end users. As the contact time of the vehicles with the nearest access points is very less, so by integrating vehicles with the cloud environment can provide various services to the end users even with their high mobility. Keeping focus on these points, this paper proposed a new optimized strategy selection for data dissemination using a stochastic coalition game in VCPS environment. Vehicles in the coalition game are assumed as the players of the game which access a finite number of resources from the cloud. Learning automata (LA) stationed on the vehicles collect and process the information from the environment based upon pre-defined strategies. They are assumed to form a coalition based upon predictive clustering among one another using a pre-defined metric. Based upon the payoff matrix, each player executes, algorithms for cluster and leadership formation. Moreover, an algorithm for centralized supervision is also designed. At any instant in the game, only those players are allowed to make a move which are having highest payoff value so as to make a balance with respect to the moves taken by all the players in the game. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using various evaluation metrics in different network scenarios. The results obtained show that the proposed scheme is better than the case where it is not applied. Specifically, there is an increase of 10\u201320 % in packet delivery ratio and 20 % reduction in delay in accessing various services from the cloud using the proposed scheme."},

In this paper, based on our experience implementing a prototype WSN for an aerospace application, we identify two practical approaches that in combination significantly reduce energy use for sensor nodes using the Z-Stack network stack. While these solutions are necessarily platform-specific, they are expected to translate to other wireless node platforms. The solutions presented use non-default platform features in order to solve the issues of i) high power consumption on node startup due to network discovery and joining and ii) high power consumption of application level acknowledgements. The startup power consumption was reduced by 94.7%, while the cost of a sense-process-transmit-acknowledge cycle was reduced by 38.6%. This represents a significant reduction in node power consumption and is an important step in enabling the use of power harvesting."},

In order to gain insight into the convection taking place in the Earth\u2019s tangent cylinder, we target regimes of asymptotically strong rotation. The critical Rayleigh number Rac and critical wavenumber ac are computed numerically by solving the linear stability problem in a systematic way, with either stress-free or no-slip kinematic boundary conditions. A parametric study is conducted, varying the Ekman number E (ratio of viscous to Coriolis forces) and the Elsasser number \u039b (ratio of the Lorentz force to the Coriolis force). E is varied from 10\u22129\nto 10\u22122 and \u039b from 10\u22123 to 1. For a wide range of thermal and magnetic Prandtl numbers, our results verify and confirm previous experimental and theoretical results showing the existence of two distinct unstable modes at low values of E\u2013one being controlled by the magnetic field, the other being controlled by viscosity (often called the viscous mode). It is shown that oscillatory onset does not occur in the range of parameters we are interested in. Asymptotic scalings for the onset of these modes are numerically confirmed and their domain of validity is precisely quantified. We show that with no-slip boundary conditions, the asymptotic behavior is reached for E < 10\u22126 and establish a map in the (E,\u039b) plane. We distinguish regions where convection sets in either through the magnetic mode or through the viscous mode. Our analysis gives the regime in which the transition between magnetic and viscous modes may be observed.

In this paper, the VM consolidation problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, which has three conflicting objectives, i.e., reducing power consumption, achieving good load balancing and shortening VM migration time. We propose a multi-objective optimization algorithm based on biogeography-based optimization (BBO) for the VM consolidation problem, which is named as MBBO/DE: Multi-objective Biogeography-Based Optimization algorithm hybrid with Differential Evolution. It utilizes cosine migration model, differential strategies and Gaussian mutation model to improve the quality of habitats and the ability of finding optimal solutions. Experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of MBBO/DE using synthetic and real-world instances. Experimental results show that MBBO/DE obtains a better performance while simultaneously reducing power consumption and achieving good load balancing within a satisfactory time as compared to genetic algorithm (GA), differential evolution (DE), ant colony optimization (ACO) and BBO."},

Axially symmetric disturbances are considered in the inductionless approximation corresponding to zero magnetic Prandtl number. Axial symmetry allows us to reveal an entirely new electromagnetic instability. First, we show that the electric current passing through the liquid can extend the range of helical magnetorotational instability (HMRI) indefinitely by transforming it into a purely electromagnetic instability. Two different electromagnetic instability mechanisms are identified. The first is an internal pinch-type instability, which is due to the interaction of the electric current with its own magnetic field. Axisymmetric mode of this instability requires a free-space component of the azimuthal magnetic field. When the azimuthal component of the magnetic field is purely rotational and the axial component is nonzero, a new kind of electromagnetic instability emerges. The latter, driven by the interaction of electric current with a weak collinear magnetic field in a quiescent fluid, gives rise to a steady meridional circulation coupled with azimuthal rotation.\n\n"},

We find that even a marginal reduction in the particle\u2019s density from that of the fluid can result in strong modification of its dynamics. In contrast to classical spatial filtering arguments and predictions of particle models, we find that the particle acceleration variance increases with size. We trace this reversed trend back to the growing contribution from wake-induced forces, unaccounted for in current particle models in turbulence. Our findings highlight the need for improved multiphysics based models that account for particle wake effects for a faithful representation of buoyant-sphere dynamics in turbulence.\n\n"},

Filling this gap is one of the main aims of the Games and Learning Alliance (http://www.galanoe.eu) European Network of Excellence on Serious Games, which has a focus upon pedagogy-driven SGs. This paper relies on the assumption that the fundamental aspect of SG design consists in the translation of learning goals/practices into mechanical element of gameplay, serving to an instructional purpose beside that of play and fun. This paper proposes the Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) model, which supports SG analysis and design by allowing reflection on the various pedagogical and game elements in an SG. The LM-GM model includes a set of pre-defined game mechanics and pedagogical elements that we have abstracted from literature on game studies and learning theories. Designers and analysts can exploit these mechanics to draw the LM-GM map for a game, so as to identify and highlight its main pedagogical and entertainment features, and their interrelations. The tool may also be useful for teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of a given game and better understand how to implement it in educational settings. A case study is reported to illustrate the framework's support in determining how gameplay and pedagogy intertwine in an SG. Finally, the paper presents the results of two comparative user tests demonstrating the advantages of the proposed model with respect to a similar state-of-the-art framework. \u00b8 2014 British Educational Research Association.\n\n"},

With an explosive increase of their use we need expand the aspect of evaluating the security issues wireless networks. Majority of household are using the latest secured protocols the WPA2 with a government grade standard nowadays. These protocols are still vulnerable to dictionary attacks that are normally carried out by recording three-way handshakes between the wireless router and the connected client. This method is really common and widely used - its success depends on the strength of the password being used. The research presented here shows another efficient method of hijacking and breaking into home networks is by using a Man-in-the-Middle type attack. The proposed system is implemented on a Raspberry Pi carried by a drone. While until recently UAV's (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) have been used mainly by militaries and some specialist organisations, nowadays they have become widely available, cheaper and user friendly. The use of a drone allows the system to cover a wide area of potential targets as well as relatively quickly move from one target and WiFi network to another. The system is based on war flying using commercially available drones (Wang, 2006). The main goal of this project is to be able to hijack a wireless connection session between a connected tablet PC and Access Point using WPA2 encryption. We will be able to automate a Man in the Middle attack just by flying the drone around a certain area, setting up a rogue access point and being able to harvest important credentials from the targeted wireless networks and connected devices. The system is based on a number of open source Wi-Fi penetration testing and configuration tools including iwconfig or airmon-ng and custom scripts. The drone payload (Raspberry Pi B+) is using two wireless dongles; one for monitoring the wireless networks and the other one for being the rogue access point. The Raspberry Pi is powered by a 1000 mAh battery and carried by a DJI Phantom Drone. The device is also capable of other types of attacks. Such as disconnecting devices from its currently connected networks or causing denial of service attack against wireless routers/hubs while remaining stealthy to the victim(s) and operating from a distance."},

We show that combining neural activity across two brains increases accuracy to guide evolutionary search more effectively. The IGA system involves a simple task of evolving a polygon shape to approximate the shape of a target polygon. Two candidates visually inspected the evolved polygons and mentally ranked them (independently from each other) from 1\u00d710 based on their similarity to the target polygon. In parallel, the IGA system evaluated the fitness of evolved polygons using a standard fitness function. The IGA system was run for a few generations, before evolution was paused and EEG signals were collected from the two candidates. The collected EEG signals were used to train a regression model that received unseen EEG as input and mapped this into fitness values. The trained model was then used to guide the IGA solely by using the EEG signals. Off-line experimental results showed that it was possible to build better regression models that are trained using two EEG signals to capture participants evaluation of fitness. This paper demonstrates the possibility of a new domain of applications for interactive evolution where standard fitness calculations can be replaced with multiple EEG signals for guiding an optimisation process."},

Contrary to the abundance of models that use two neural networks one for the actor and one for the critic, this model sets up the actor as a layer seconded by another layer which deduce the value function. Therefore, the effect is to have similar to a critic outcome combined with the actor in one network. Hence, the model paves the way for a deep reinforcement learning architecture for future work The reward signal is back propagated through the critic then the actor. At the same time, the features layer have been deeply trained by applying a simple PCA on the whole set of images histograms acquired during the first running episode. The model is then able to shrink the whole architecture to fit a new reduced features dimension. Initial experimental result on real robot shows that the agent accomplished good level of accuracy and efficacy in reaching the goal.\n\n"},

Collaborative modelling of the knowledge domain is used as an approach to the elicitation of safety knowledge from experts. From this a series of knowledge models is derived to inform decision making. This is achieved by using Bayesian networks as a knowledge modelling scheme underpinning a safety prognosis tool to serve meaningful prognostics information and visualise such information to predict safety violations. \n\nFindings: Collaborative modelling of safety-critical knowledge is a valid approach to knowledge elicitation and its sharing across the railway industry. This approach overcomes some of the key limitations of existing approaches to knowledge elicitation. Such models become an effective tool for prediction of safety cases by using railway data. This is demonstrated using Passenger-Train Interaction safety data. \n\n\nPractical implications: This study contributes to practice in two main directions: by documenting an effective approach to knowledge elicitation and knowledge sharing, while also helping the transport industry to understand safety. \n\nSocial implications: By supporting the railway industry in their efforts to understand safety this research has the potential to benefit railway passengers, staff and communities in general, which is a priority for the transport sector. \n\nOriginality/value: This research applies a knowledge elicitation approach to understanding safety based on collaborative modelling, which is a novel approach in the context of transport.\n\n"},

Some evidence indicates that invasive plant species might benefit from climate change via these features. However, apart from theory-based predictions, knowledge of the tolerance of invasive species to short-term climatic stress is very limited. We investigated whether three naturalized alien plant species in central Europe, Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Hieracium aurantiacum and Lysimachia punctata perform better under stressful conditions than comparable native species. A greenhouse experiment with a fixed stress sequence of frost, drought and water logging was set up. We applied this stress treatment to two life history stages (seedling and adult plants), plants grown in monoculture (mild intraspecific competition) and in a highly competitive setting with intra- and interspecific competition. Whilst small differences in plant responses were detected the alien species overall were not more tolerant to stress. The responses of alien and native congeners/confamilials to stress in all treatments (monoculture, competition, adult, seedling) were similar, which indicates that stress thresholds are phylogenetically conserved. All species were more vulnerable to stress at the seedling stage and when subject to competition. Our data indicates that results obtained from experiments using onlymonocultures and one development stage are not appropriate for drawing generalizations about lethal thresholds. Moreover, rather abrupt species-specific thresholds exist, which indicates that a prediction of species responses based on just two stress levels, as is the case in most studies, is not sufficient."},

In this paper, an approach to learning style adaptivity is proposed for the teaching of computer security. An e-learning system was developed to provide more personalised and adaptive learning, based on the information perception style of the Felder-Silverman model. This is the dimension of learning style, which has received the least attention in published research. In the approach, a personalised sequence of learning material is generated based on an individual learning style. The approach is evaluated in order to determine its effectiveness in learning provision. An experiment conducted with sixty subjects produced significant results.

The steady-state visually evoked potential based brain computer interfaces (BCI), which apply visual stimulus, are very suitable to play the role of communication interface for patients with neuromuscular impairments. In this study, the entropy encoding algorithm is proposed to encode the letters of multilevel selection interface for BCI text input systems. According to the appearance frequency of each letter, the entropy encoding algorithm is proposed to construct a variable-length tree for the letter arrangement of multilevel selection interface. Then, the Gaussian mixture models are applied to recognize electrical activity of the brain. According to the recognition results, the multilevel selection interface guides the subject to spell and type the words. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach outperforms the baseline system, which does not consider the appearance frequency of each letter.

The domain considered is bounded by periodic boundary conditions in the two directions perpendicular to the magnetic field and by two plane Hartmann walls in the third direction. Regimes of high magnetic fields (Hartmann number of up to 896) are reached thanks to a new spectral method using the eigenvectors of the dissipation operator. The decay is found to proceed through two phases: first, energy and integral length scales vary rapidly during a two-dimensionalisation phase extending over approximately a Hartmann friction time. During this phase, the evolution of the former appears significantly more impeded by the presence of walls than that of the latter. Once the large scales are nearly quasi-two-dimensional, the decay results from the competition of a two-dimensional dynamics driven by dissipation in the Hartmann boundary layers and the three-dimensional dynamics of smaller scales. In the later stages of the decay, three-dimensionality subsists under the form of barrel-shaped structures. A purely quasi-two dimensional decay entirely dominated by friction in the Hartmann layers is not reached because of residual dissipation in the bulk. However, this dissipation is not generated by the three-dimensionality that subsists, but by residual viscous friction due to horizontal velocity gradients. In the process, the energy in the velocity component aligned with the magnetic field is found to be strongly suppressed, as is skewness. This result reproduces the experimental findings of Kolesnikov & Tsinober (Fluid Dyn., vol. 9, 1974, pp. 621\u2013624), where, as in the present simulations, Hartmann walls were present."},

The evolution of the structure is determined indirectly from a carefully built transformation of the eigenvector matrices of the coupling Laplacians, which are guaranteed to change smoothly in time. In turn, this allows one to extend the master stability function formalism, which can be used to assess the stability of a synchronized state. This approach is independent from the particular topologies that the network visits, and is not restricted to commuting structures. Also, it does not depend on the time scale of the evolution, which can be faster than, comparable to, or even secular with respect to the dynamics of the units."},

A high level of satisfaction can increase the motivation of students, their engagement and experience, and therefore improve their learning. This paper is concerned with the investigation of the effect of adaptation based on learning style on students' satisfaction. An adaptive approach, which involves the construction of personalised learning paths based on learning style, was implemented in an adaptive e-learning system. A controlled experiment in this learning environment was conducted with sixty undergraduate students to evaluate their level of satisfaction with the system. The results indicate that the students were generally satisfied with their learning experience. It can be concluded that adaptation of learning content according to learning style can improve student satisfaction and enhance their experience and motivation.\n\n"},

Blended approaches to implementing game-based learning as part of distance or technology-enhanced education have led to demonstrations of the benefits they might bring, allowing learners to interact with immersive technologies as part of a broader, structured learning experience. In this article, we explore how the integration of a serious game can be extended to a learning content management system (LCMS) to support a blended and holistic approach, described as an 'intuitive-guided' method. Through a case study within the EU-Funded Adaptive Learning via Intuitive/Interactive, Collaborative and Emotional Systems (ALICE) project, a technical integration of a gaming engine with a proprietary LCMS is demonstrated, building upon earlier work and demonstrating how this approach might be realized. In particular, how this method can support an intuitive-guided approach to learning is considered, whereby the learner is given the potential to explore a non-linear environment whilst scaffolding and blending provide guidance ensuring targeted learning objectives are met. Through an evaluation of the developed prototype with 32 students aged 14-16 across two Italian schools, a varied response from learners is observed, coupled with a positive reception from tutors. The study demonstrates that challenges remain in providing high-fidelity content in a classroom environment, particularly as an increasing gap in technology availability between leisure and school times emerges."},

Though such effects can be modeled by numerical models, the proposed analytical methods are particularly helpful in optimizing machine design, inverter rating, reactive power management, and grid low-voltage ride-through performance. The conventional analytical methods cannot be readily applied to the BDFM due to its complex magnetic field distribution; this paper presents analytical methods to calculate the magnetizing and leakage inductances for the BDFM with magnetic wedges used in the stator slots.

One of the important components of expert systems is data classifiers, and in this paper, I present the use of Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN) with a Gaussian function as data classifier for heart disease classification. The proposed method in the paper makes use of same training data after they are used for training to reduce false classifications which makes this project unique in itself. For development and testing, I utilized patient records from Prince Sultan Cardiac Center-Qassim in Saudi Arabia. This paper discusses the use of RBFN for the classification of heart diseases, and it proposes a model system that forms data collection, processing, storage, and usage procedures."},

Instead of directly collecting personal user information, we aim to infer user preferences by detecting behavior patterns from publicly available micro blogging content and users\u2019 followers\u2019 network. With statistical and machine-learning methods, we employ Twitter-specific features to predict country origin of users on Twitter with an accuracy of more than 90% for users from the most active countries.

The charging and discharging periods are crucially important for improving the efficiency of the PV battery. An optimal control scheme for energy storage systems in LV networks is introduced to facilitate demand response (DR). The method described also regulates thermal violation and voltage violation caused by PV generation. Finally, the paper uses a five node LV network and typical household profiles to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. The benefits in terms of load shift are shown under three different configurations by using a selected lithium-ion battery."},

In the latter case, we propose automated negotiation models for a negotiation team that negotiates with an opponent by means of the bilateral alternating protocol.

One basic network property that relates to the structure of the links found is the degree assortativity, which is a measure of the correlation between the degrees of the nodes at the end of the links. Degree correlations are known to affect both the structure of a network and the dynamics of the processes supported thereon, including the resilience to damage, the spread of information and epidemics, and the efficiency of defence mechanisms. Nonetheless, while many studies focus on undirected scale-free networks, the interactions in real-world systems often have a directionality. Here, we investigate the dependence of the degree correlations on the power-law exponents in directed scale-free networks. To perform our study, we consider the problem of building directed networks with a prescribed degree distribution, providing a method for proper generation of power-law-distributed directed degree sequences. Applying this new method, we perform extensive numerical simulations, generating ensembles of directed scale-free networks with exponents between 2 and 3, and measuring ensemble averages of the Pearson correlation coefficients. Our results show that scale-free networks are on average uncorrelated across directed links for three of the four possible degree-degree correlations, namely in-degree to in-degree, in-degree to out-degree, and out-degree to out-degree. However, they exhibit anticorrelation between the number of outgoing connections and the number of incoming ones. The findings are consistent with an entropic origin for the observed disassortativity in biological and technological networks."},

Since several users and systems may coexist in these environments, it is quite possible that entities with opposing preferences need to cooperate to reach their respective goals. Automated negotiation is pointed as one of the mechanisms that may provide a solution to this kind of problems. In this article, a multi-issue bilateral bargaining model for Ambient Intelligence domains is presented where it is assumed that agents have computational bounded resources and do not know their opponents\u2019 preferences. The main goal of this work is to provide negotiation models that obtain efficient agreements while maintaining the computational cost low. A niching genetic algorithm is used before the negotiation process to sample one\u2019s own utility function (self-sampling). During the negotiation process, genetic operators are applied over the opponent\u2019s and one\u2019s own offers in order to sample new offers that are interesting for both parties. Results show that the proposed model is capable of outperforming similarity heuristics which only sample before the negotiation process and of obtaining similar results to similarity heuristics which have access to all of the possible offers."},

Instead of directly using the ECG data of a person as the feature, first, it is shown that a few number of reflection coefficients extracted from the autocorrelation function of the data can efficiently perform the recognition task. Next, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients are utilized as features, which offer even a better recognition performance. A combination of these two features is found to demonstrate a high within class compactness and between class separation. A pre-processing scheme is incorporated prior to feature extraction to reduce the effect of different noises and artefacts. In the recognition phase, a linear discriminant based classifier is employed, where the two features are jointly utilized. The proposed human identification method has been tested on a standard ECG database and high recognition accuracy is achieved with a low feature dimension."},

Electro-acoustic detection of different particles (including carbon, gold, sucrose, silicon, and PTFE) with different particle diameters studied. The mass sensitivity \u0394f/\u0394m of the SAWR was found to be typically 275 Hz/ng or nearly 4 Hz/pg for the detection of 750 nm diameter gold particles.

Different strategies are being sought after to comply with stringent emission regulations being enforced on the global automotive market.

This paper presents 1-D CFD simulation using Ricardo WAVE of 30 % downsizing on a 2.0 litre naturally aspirated spark ignition engine to a 1.4 litre turbocharged gasoline direct injection variable valve timing engine. Performance improvement has been achieved by using turbocharging and variable valve technology. Turbocharging a spark ignition engine increases the intake temperature and pressure, causing the mixture to detonate. To prevent engine mixture detonation, direct injection has been used, which also allows an increase in the compression ratio. The downsized engine has been optimised for maximum volumetric efficiency, maximum brake mean effective pressure and knock elimination. Valve opening timing, their durations and lifts have been optimised to improve volumetric efficiency. Fuel-air ratio and start of injection timing have also been optimised to improve the maximum brake mean effective pressure. The results indicated 74 % improvement in torque, 102 % improvement"},

Mobile learning poses a challenge to established instructional strategies with respect to delivering feedback and monitoring learner progress, particularly in informal and incidental learning occurring outside of formal structured learning environments. We argue that well-designed and managed feedback and progress indicators can offer guidance and a sense of structure to learners in the absence of a formal curriculum, accreditation or set outcomes. Furthermore, they can encourage casual users of mobile applications to move from fragmented learning episodes towards a more long term and reflective learning journey. In this paper we describe how we are developing feedback and progress indicators for the EU-funded MASELTOV project, which explores how smartphones can support language learning and social inclusion for recent immigrants to Europe. Presenting educational services and materials on mobile devices allows learning episodes to be incorporated into daily activities and schedules, to be accessed at times and in places that suit learners best. Feedback and progress indicators embedded into these services may motivate such an audience to reconceptualise fragmentary, ephemeral educational experiences into a more coherent, sustained learning journey. We describe how feedback and progress indicators have been used successfully in web-based and games-based learning, and our assessment of which types may best support incidental mobile learning and the challenges we face.\n\n"},

Body part equivalent temperature at eight segments and cabin sensor data (air temperature, surface temperature, mean radiant temperature, humidity and solar load) was gathered in a variety of environmental and cabin conditions. 38 experimental hours of trials in a controlled environment and 26 experimental hours of realistic driving trials were used for training and evaluating the estimator's performance. The estimation errors were on average between 0.5\u00b0C and 1.9\u00b0C for different body parts for trials within a controlled environment, while for trials in realistic driving scenarios they ranged between 1\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C.

The proposal seeks to guarantee an upper bound on energy consumption by pruning the negotiation space via a genetic algorithm, and to take advantage of the negotiation for increasing user satisfaction.

It is shown that the use of autocorrelation operation on a speech signal, which is band-limited to a particular formant zone, in comparison to one without any band limitation, can provide higher noise immunity, especially under severe noisy condition. In order to extract each formant, a modified higher order Yule-Walker method is employed on the resulting autocorrelation sequence. Within a band, the pole with the maximum energy is selected as the formant. The estimated formants are used as features along with conventional Mel frequency cepstral coefficients in a vowel recognition system, where the linear discriminant based classifier is utilized. Extensive experimentation is carried out on speech samples taken from the TIMIT standard speech database. It is found that the proposed algorithm provides superior formant estimation accuracy in comparison to that obtained by some of the state of the art methods even at a very low level of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both male and female speakers. Moreover, formant estimates obtained by the proposed method can also provide better vowel recognition accuracy in the presence of significant background noise."},

Even when catalogues exist in a searchable digital format (which is not certain), formatting differences and the nature of the information to be encoded mean that there is a very large degree of variation in records not just from different catalogues but within individual catalogues. The nature of the data being searched means that traditional search techniques are badly suited to the challenges of identifying similar records in collections. In this paper we discuss a fuzzy rule based approach for identifying similarities between records and to identify co-referent records across multiple heritage collections. We also describe the application of this approach to real world collections and records which demonstrates some promising early results."},

The EWV transition filters proposed here increase the classification accuracy by 1% over unfiltered results in realistic scenarios and significantly reduces spurious classifier output in real-time visualizations. A 200 fold transmission reduction from the on-body system to an outside system was achieved in practice by combining the transition filters with an event-based design. Furthermore, a method of reducing transmissions between on-body data gathering nodes based on distributed processing of the classifier rules (but maintaining a one-way flow of communications during system use) is also described. This provides a 3.3 fold reduction in packets and a 13.5 fold reduction in data transmitted from one node to the other in a two-node wearable system."},

The purpose of this pilot study is to test my methodology before undertaking the larger study. It explores the prior awareness, perceptions and attitude to plagiarism of some Nigerian students studying in Coventry University, United Kingdom. In this pilot study, group interview was organised and questionnaires disseminated to some Masters level study skills students. An analysis of the findings revealed prior levels of plagiarism awareness, several themes of perceptions and attitude to plagiarism. This pilot study reveals a need for more training on scholarly academic writing for Nigerian students who have come to study in the United Kingdom for the first time.

We choose interaction parameters as is done for a standard model, i.e., the Lennard-Jones fluid and we consider symmetric chains, i.e., the multiblock copolymer consists of an even number n of alternating chemically different A and B blocks of the same length N A = N B = N. We show how usual static properties of the individual blocks and the whole multiblock chain can reflect the phase behavior of such macromolecules. Also, how parameters, such as the number of blocks n can affect properties of the individual blocks, when chains are in a poor solvent for a certain range of n. A detailed discussion of the static properties of these symmetric multiblock copolymers is also given. Our results in combination with recent simulation results on the behavior of multiblock copolymer chains provide a complete picture for the behavior of these macromolecules under poor solvent conditions, at least for this most symmetrical case. Due to the standard choice of our parameters, our system can be used as a benchmark for related models, which aim at capturing the basic aspects of the behavior of various biological systems."},

All the input and the output strings are of the same length, and two strings are far if their Hamming distance is greater than or equal to a given threshold. FFMSP belongs to the class of sequence consensus problems which have applications in molecular biology, amongst others. FFMSP is NP-hard. It does not admit a constant-ratio approximation either, unless P=NP. In the last few years, heuristic and metaheuristic algorithms have been proposed for the problem, which use local search and require a heuristic, also called an evaluation function, to evaluate candidate solutions during local search. The heuristic function used, for this purpose, in these algorithms is the problem\u2019s objective function. However, since many candidate solutions can be of the same objective value, the resulting search landscape includes many points which correspond to local maxima. In this paper, we devise a new heuristic function to evaluate candidate solutions. We then incorporate the proposed heuristic function within a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), a metaheuristic originally proposed for the problem by Festa. The resulting algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art with respect to solution quality, in some cases by orders of magnitude, on both random and real data in our experiments. The results indicate that the number of local optima is considerably reduced using the proposed heuristic."},

Performance of the stove with resistive and diode bridge loads are compared to evaluate how nonlinear loads affect thermo-acoustic performance. The detailed construction and design issue of the tested prototype is presented. The engine pressure and the temperature profile of the Hot heat exchanger (HHX), Ambient heat exchanger (AHX), water outlet (Twout) and water inlet (Twin) have been measured and analysed to see the variation of the peak pressure and onset temperature of oscillation. Several Experiments have been carried out using different length feed back pipe with different sizes tuning stub in order to match the engine frequency with the Alternator to achieve the high electrical output. Electrical load on the linear alternator was simulated with a load box that can present a resistive, diode bridge plus capacitor, or diode bridge plus lead acid battery. Variations of pressure and temperature of the engine as well as electrical power were measured. Since the ultimate goal is to supply the power to the 12 V lead acid battery and it is necessary to match the acoustic impedance with the battery rectifier circuit to achieve the maximum output power. This paper will show that the engine with the bridge rectifier load acted the same as a resistive load that absorbed the same power. Neither of the non-linear loads had any measureable effect on conversion efficiency. "},

Therefore, several approximation and (meta) heuristic algorithms have been proposed which aim at finding good, but not necessarily optimal, solutions to the problem. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm based on the constructive beam search method. We have devised a novel heuristic, inspired by the probability theory, intended for domains where the input strings are assumed to be independent. Special data structures and dynamic programming methods are developed to reduce the time complexity of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is compared with the state-of-the-art over several standard benchmarks including random and real biological sequences. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art by giving higher quality solutions with less computation time for most of the experimental cases."},

Performance, however, reduces when the system is tested using samples from a male volunteer not in the training set using a low cost microphone. Through the use of an unsupervised neural approach, it is possible to go beyond the basic binary classification of emotions to consider the similarity between emotions and whether speech can express multiple emotions at the same time"},

But although there is a considerable amount of bibliographic and other kinds of data on the Web that share similar information, a standardized way of structuring such data in a way that makes it easy to identify significant relationships does not yet exist. In the case of historical photographs, the challenge is further exacerbated by the enormous range of subjects depicted, and the fact that surviving records are not always complete, accurate, or consistent and the amount of text available per record is very small. Fuzzy-matching algorithms combined with semantic similarity techniques offer a way of finding potential matches between such items when standard ontology and corpus-based approaches are inadequate, in this case helping researchers for the first time match photographs held in different archives to historical exhibition catalogue records."},

Creating effective interventions, which stimulate peer involvement, remains a demanding task and finding a solution that is not only engaging but also pedagogically sound is vital. A case thus exists for exploring how game technology might facilitate more feasible solutions. This paper presents the development approach of a digital game: PR:EPARe (Positive Relationships: Eliminating Coercion and Pressure in Adolescent Relationships), designed by a cross-disciplinary team of UK researchers from Coventry University's Studies in Adolescent Sexual Health (SASH) research group and the Serious Games Institute (SGI). Psychological targets for game content were identified through Intervention Mapping (IM) and the game design process was based on the Four-Dimensional Framework of Learning (4DF) emphasizing the context of deployment, learner profiling and the pedagogical perspective that influence the mode of representation of the learning content. Early efficacy testing of the game solution was validated through a cluster-randomized controlled trial in local schools (n = 505) indicated some positive outcomes in favour of the game-based approach, based on self-reported measures of psycho-social preparedness for avoiding coercion (F [3, 501] = 15.306, p <.001, \u03b72p [please see printed abstract for correct symbol] = 0.084). Analysis of observation data suggests that blending this interactive game-based approach with traditional classroom delivery encouraged the teachers and students to engage in communal discussions and debriefing during and after game play. Together, the results demonstrated real benefits for pedagogy-driven game-based approaches to support the delivery of RSE within a classroom setting."},

This effort has led to a fragmented landscape of competing metadata schemas, such as IEEE LOM or ADL SCORM, and interface mechanisms, such as OAI-PMH, SQI and REST-ful services in general. More recently, semantic technologies were taken into account to improve interoperability. However, so far Web-scale integration of resources is not facilitated, mainly due to the lack of take-up of shared principles, datasets and schemas. On the other hand, the Linked Data approach has emerged as the de facto standard for sharing data on the Web and is fundamentally based on established W3C standards. This paper presents results of the European Commission-funded project mEducator, which exploits Linked Data principles for (1) semantic integration and (2) social interconnecting of educational data, resources and actors. We describe a general approach to exploit the wealth of already existing educational data on the Web by allowing its exposure as Linked Data and by taking into account automated enrichment and interlinking techniques to provide a rich and well-interlinked graph for the educational domain. Additionally, the paper presents an evaluation of our work with respect to a set of socio-semantic dimensions.

The topic of agent-based negotiation teams has been recently introduced in multi-agent research. Therefore, it is necessary to identify good practices, challenges, and related research that may help in advancing the state-of-the-art in agent-based negotiation teams. For that reason, in this article we review the tasks to be carried out by agent-based negotiation teams. Each task is analyzed and related with current advances in different research areas.

Moreover, an estimate of the distance between the outcome of the subspace correction method and the global minimizer of the nonsmooth objective is derived. This estimate and numerical experiments for image denoising, inpainting, and deblurring indicate that in practice the proposed subspace correction methods indeed approach the global solution of the underlying minimization problem."},

To this end, the EduGameLab project has developed a tool for sharing experiences about educational games among educators and parents. The development of this tool was based on a metadata schema for formally describing serious games and experiences with these games. In this paper we report on the development of this tool, revisit and refine the metadata schema based on our experiences and evaluate the usability and usefulness of the tool based on feedback gathered at practical workshops with educators.\n\n"},

To reduce the computational effort required for the calculation of EVPIs, we have used Gaussian process (GP) emulators to approximate the cost rate model. Results from the analysis allow us to identify the most important parameters in terms of the benefit of 'learning' by focussing on the partial expected value of perfect information for a parameter. The analysis determines the optimal solution and the expected related cost when the parameters are unknown and partially known. This type of analysis can be used to ensure that both maintenance calculations and resulting recommendations are sufficiently robust. \u00a9 2013 Elsevier Ltd."},

However, the main disadvantage of fluoroscopic imaging is the lack of soft tissue information and harmful radiation. In contrast, ultrasound (US) has the advantages of low-cost, non-radiation, and high contrast in soft tissue. In this paper we propose a framework to extract the catheter from both X-ray and US images in real time for cardiac interventions. The catheter extraction from X-ray images is based on SURF features, local patch analysis and Kalman filtering to acquire a set of sorted key points representing the catheter. At the same time, the transformation between the X-ray and US images can be obtained via 2D/3D rigid registration between a 3D model of the US probe and its projection on X-ray images. By backprojecting the information about the catheter location in the X-ray images to the US images the search space can be drastically reduced. The extraction of the catheter from US is based on 3D SURF feature clusters, graph model building, A* algorithm and B-spline smoothing. Experiments show the overall process can be achieved in 2.72 seconds for one frame and the reprojected error is 1.99 mm on average."},

We show that if the proportion of knights and knaves is within a certain range, the network self-organizes to a perfectly bipartite state. However, if the excess of one of the two classes is greater than a threshold value, bipartiteness is not observed. We offer a detailed theoretical analysis of the behavior of the model, investigate its behavior in the thermodynamic limit and argue that it provides a simple example of a topology-driven model whose behavior is strongly reminiscent of first-order phase transitions far from equilibrium."},

Much of the published work in this context has typically focused on the use of generalized linear models, which are non-dynamic in the sense that the parameters in the model, which often represent the underlying abilities of each team, are assumed to remain constant over time. Dynamic generalized linear models (DGLMs) on the other hand allow the abilities of each team to vary over time. This paper illustrates the application of a DGLM in the context of football match outcome prediction and describes improvements on similar work previously presented by the author, in relation to the estimation of a parameter in the model, referred to as the evolution variance, which is crucial in terms of optimizing the predictive performance of these types of models. Match results data from the Scottish Premier League from 2003/2004 to 2005/2006 are used to show that the DGLM approach provides improved predictive probabilities of future match outcomes compared to the non-dynamic form of the model. DGLMs are also Bayesian in terms of their structure and so a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation is required. This paper therefore illustrates a practical implementation of the DGLM model that can easily be deployed using the freely available software WinBUGS."},

In this paper, an inventory control model for a reverse logistics network with distinguishable quality levels of returned products, two alternative recovery routes including repair and remanufacturing routes and a disposal route, in addition to the traditional production route, is proposed.

Thus, team members need to analyze their environment in order to select the most appropriate strategy according to the current conditions. In this paper, we analyze how environmental conditions affect different intra-team strategies in order to provide teams with the knowledge necessary to select the proper intra-team strategy."},

An important problem for the performance of the Virtual Organization is the distribution of the agents across the computational resources. The final distribution should provide a good load balancing for the organization. In this article, a genetic algorithm is applied to calculate a proper distribution across hosts in an agent-based Virtual Organization. Additionally, an abstract multi-agent system architecture which provides infrastructure for Virtual Organization distribution is introduced. The developed genetic solution employs an elitist crossover operator where one of the children inherits the most promising genetic material from the parents with higher probability. In order to validate the genetic proposal, the designed genetic algorithm has been successfully compared to several heuristics in different scenarios."},

Stream-flow series of the annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean in Ahvaz hydrometric station as representative of the watershed have been considered. In order to determine the change points, we use the Pettitt test while the trend in the annual stream-flow series of this station is evaluated by the Mann-Kendall test. However, the Pettitt test cannot detect any change point in these series, but the Mann-Kendall test shows that there is an increasing trend. This increasing trend has no fitness with observed data in recent decade. Therefore, the potential change points were determined and consequently, these series converted to two sub-series based on the results obtained from the Pettitt test, wide variation from human activities and variation of hydro climatic conditions. We then applied the Mann-Kendall test in these two sub-series which showed significant decreasing trend in both of them. From this method, it can be concluded that the averages of the second sub-series are larger than the first one in the three annual stream-flow series. This increasing ratio is equal to 1.34, 1.16 and 1.2 for stream-flow series of annual maximum, annual minimum and annual mean respectively. These changes are similar to changes in annual rainfall time series. We can say that the sudden increase of precipitation in recent decades makes the averages of the second sub-series larger. Results showed that inspite of wide range human induced changes, stream-flow series is more affected from the watershed rainfall time series variations. In addition, significant decreasing trend in the two sub-series can be due to the following causes: the growth of population, temperature rise, construction of three dams on the Karun River, implementing the different projects for developing agricultural, and conservation from soil and water resources."},

This paper describes the on-going development and evaluation of a serious game (SG) to raise awareness on experiences of sexual coercion. This involves an iterative process that draws on stakeholder engagement and the theory and evidence base for what works, to support health improvement intervention planning. SG developers took the game concept plan and transformed it into an interactive game show, led by a teacher or facilitator to engage students in game play and discussion around the issue of sexual coercion. The final product known as PR:EPARe (Positive Relationships: Eliminating Coercion and Pressure in Adolescent Relationships) is currently the subject of a cluster Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) in local schools. Early data analysis shows that the learners are engaged with the game with potential contribution to psychological preparedness to deal with sexual coercion.

When the system is placed in a sufficiently strong external field, however, the size of clusters of like spins diverges. There is evidence that this percolation transition is in the universality class of standard site percolation. It has been claimed that, for small disorder, a similar percolation phenomenon also occurs in zero external field. Using exact algorithms, we study ground states of large samples and find little evidence for a transition at zero external field. Nevertheless, for sufficiently small random-field strengths, there is an extended region of the phase diagram, where finite samples are indistinguishable from a critical percolating system. In this regime we examine ground-state domain walls, finding strong evidence that they are conformally invariant and satisfy Schramm\u2013Loewner evolution (SLE\u03ba) with parameter \u03ba=6. These results add support to the hope that at least some aspects of systems with quenched disorder might be ultimately studied with the techniques of SLE and conformal field theory."},

When the two temperatures are unequal the system is driven by an energy flow through the system from the higher temperature heat-bath to the lower temperature one and reaches a far-from-equilibrium steady state. We show that the nonequilibrium phase diagram contains three phases: A homogenous disordered phase and two phases with long range, spin-wave order. Two critical lines, representing continuous phase transitions from a homogenous disordered phase to two phases of long range order, meet at the equilibrium the KT point. The shape of the nonequilibrium critical lines as they approach the KT point is described by a crossover exponent of phi = 2.52\u00b10.05. Finally, we suggest that the transition between the two phases with long-range order is first-order, making the KT-point where all three phases meet a bicritical point."},

Robustness of inferences to misspecification of the prior density would at least ensure that a selected candidate model would give similar predictions of future data points given somewhat different priors and a given large training data set. In this paper we derive new explicit total variation bounds on the calculated posterior density as the function of the closeness of the genuine prior to the approximating one used and certain summary statistics of the calculated posterior density. We show that the approximating posterior density often converges to the genuine one as the number of sample point increases and our bounds allow us to identify when the posterior approximation might not. To prove our general results we needed to develop a new family of distance measures called local DeRobertis distances. These provide coarse non-parametric neighbourhoods and allowed us to derive elegant explicit posterior bounds in total variation. The bounds can be routinely calculated for BNs even when the sample has systematically missing observations and no conjugate analyses are possible."},

Here, we show that non-reversible Markov chains can be set up that generate correct stationary distributions, but reduce or eliminate the diffusive motion in phase space typical of the usual Monte Carlo dynamics. Our approach is based on splitting the dynamics into a set of replicas with each replica representing a biased movement in reaction-coordinate space. This introduction of an additional bias in a given replica is compensated for by choosing an appropriate dynamics on the other replicas such as to ensure the validity of global balance. First, we apply this method to a mean-field Ising model, splitting the system into two replicas: one trying to increase magnetization and the other trying to decrease it. For this simple test system, our results show that the altered dynamics is able to reduce the dynamical critical exponent. Generalizations of this scheme to simulations of the Ising model in two dimensions are discussed."},

For the random-bond version several disorder strengths are considered. We present phase diagram points of both pure and random versions and for a particular disorder strength we locate the emergence of the enhancement of ferromagnetic order observed in an earlier study in the ex-first-order regime. The critical properties of the pure model are contrasted and compared to those of the random model. Accepting, for the weak random version, the assumption of the double-logarithmic scenario for the specific heat we attempt to estimate the range of universality between the pure and random-bond models. The behavior of the strong disorder regime is also discussed and a rather complex and yet not fully understood behavior is observed.

While this is true in terms of its simplicity and universal applicability, the resulting approach suffers from the presence of temporal correlations of successive samples naturally implied by the Markov chain underlying the importance-sampling simulation. In many situations, these autocorrelations are moderate and can be easily accounted for by an appropriately adapted analysis of simulation data. They turn out to be a major hurdle, however, in the vicinity of phase transitions or for systems with complex free-energy landscapes. The critical slowing down close to continuous transitions is most efficiently reduced by the application of cluster algorithms, where they are available. For first-order transitions and disordered systems, on the other hand, macroscopic energy barriers need to be overcome to prevent dynamic ergodicity breaking. In this situation, generalized-ensemble techniques such as the multicanonical simulation method can effect impressive speedups, allowing to sample the full free-energy landscape. The Potts model features continuous as well as first-order phase transitions and is thus a prototypic example for studying phase transitions and new algorithmic approaches. I discuss the possibilities of bringing together cluster and generalized-ensemble methods to combine the benefits of both techniques. The resulting algorithm allows for the efficient estimation of the random-cluster partition function encoding the information of all Potts models, even with a non-integer number of states, for all temperatures in a single simulation run per system size.\n\n"},

The algorithm provides a weight associated with each sample, allowing the observable to be measured either uniformly over the graph ensemble, or, alternatively, with a desired distribution. Unlike other algorithms, this method always produces a sample, without back-tracking or rejections. Using a central limit theorem-based reasoning, we argue, that for large N, and for degree sequences admitting many realizations, the sample weights are expected to have a lognormal distribution. As examples, we apply our algorithm to generate networks with degree sequences drawn from power-law distributions and from binomial distributions."},

We have previously measured the scaling behavior of the central peak by scattering from a near-surface region of a V2H crystal, which has a first-order transition in the bulk. As the temperature is lowered toward the critical temperature, a crossover in critical behavior is seen, with the temperature range nearest to the critical point being characterized by mean field exponents. Near the transition, a small two-phase coexistence region is observed. The values of transition and crossover temperatures decay with depth. An explanation of these experimental results is here proposed by means of a theory in which edge dislocations in the near-surface region occur in walls oriented in the two directions normal to the surface. The strain caused by the dislocation lines causes the ordering in the crystal to occur as growth of roughly cylindrically shaped regions. After the regions have reached a certain size, the crossover in the critical behavior occurs, and mean field behavior prevails. At a still lower temperature, the rest of the material between the cylindrical regions orders via a weak first-order transition."},

Comparable exponents have been reported in a variety of physical systems.

In particular, similar exponents have been found to describe the development of magnetic order at the onset of the pseudogap transition in high-temperature superconductors.

Finally, the book looks at design partitioning on hardware/software platforms, including the use of cortical columns in the context of speech recognition application.

This work proposes to use body sensor networks (BSNs) to increase the safety of operatives in such missions through detailed physiological monitoring, fusion of health information, and remote alerts. Previous trials conducted by the authors have shown no correlation between the suit wearer's temperature at any single skin site and their core temperature, nor between single-point temperature variations and subjective thermal sensation. This paper reports on the development of a wearable, wireless, networked sensing system suitable for integration within the suit and deployment in manned missions. A sensor fusion and modeling approach is proposed that estimates the overall thermal sensation of the suit wearer, in real time, based on the multipoint temperature data. Zhang's thermal sensation model was used in this work. Modeling is performed locally to enable cooling system actuation, provide local feedback, and accommodate application specific constraints. Experimentation with the prototype confirms the importance of multisite skin measurement, timely cooling actuation, and monitoring the operative's thermal state. Evaluation of Zhang's model highlights the need for a bespoke model to account for suit and mission specific factors. The deployed BSN has been evaluated through experimental trials using a number of subjects in mission-like conditions and has been shown to be appropriate for the target application."},

Such parameters include the unpredictabilities of playing the ball, the players' shape of the day or environmental conditions such as the weather and the behavior of the audience. Under such circumstances, it appears worthwhile to analyze football score data with the toolbox of mathematical statistics in order to separate deterministic from stochastic effects and see what impact the cooperative and social nature of the \"agents\" of the system has on the resulting stochastic observables. Considering the probability distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams, it turns out that especially the tails of the distributions are not well described by the Poissonian or binomial model resulting from the assumption of uncorrelated random events. On the contrary, some more specific probability densities such as those discussed in the context of extreme-value statistics or the so-called negative binomial distribution fit these data rather well. There seemed to be no good argument to date, however, why the simplest Poissonian model fails and, instead, the latter distributions should be observed. To fill this gap, we introduced a number of microscopic models for the scoring behavior, resulting in a Bernoulli random process with a simple component of self-affirmation. These models allow us to represent the observed probability distributions surprisingly well, and the phenomenological distributions used earlier can be understood as special cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score data from many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments, including data from all past tournaments of the \"FIFA World Cup\" series, and found the proposed models to be applicable in all cases. To complete the picture, we conducted a field study with visitors of a science showcase to collect additional data from matches of tabletop football. As it turns out, also the latter data are represented well with our feedback models, underscoring their apparently rather universal applicability."},

Faced with the common problems of spatially irregular sensor distribution and intermittent sensor measurement availability, key to fulfilling the monitoring aim is filling in the spatiotemporal gaps in the data. While wireless sensor networks (WSNs) technology, combined with microelectromechanical systems availability potentially offer sensing solutions for a variety of application domains, in the context of monitoring applications a conceptual shift is needed from currently available, point-measurement-based ldquosense-and-sendrdquo systems toward the provision of phenomena field representations, in real time, enabling effective visualization of the spatiotemporal patterns. This paper argues the case for a generic, rapid prototyping framework for end-to-end sensing systems that support the approach of providing field representations for visualization. A formal approach to framework development was taken, ensuring that resulting instrumentation systems are well specified. Both the framework development and its evaluation are linked to the full cycle of requirements setting, design, and deployment of a prototype instrumentation system for aerospace applications-specifically, health monitoring of a gas turbine engine. The field monitoring application prototyping (FieldMAP) framework supports multimodal sensing, provides a number of opportunities for data processing and information extraction, caters for monitoring of the instrumentation health, offers a modular field-mapping design component and allows for real-time phenomena visualization, data and information logging, and postanalysis. Experience with the FieldMAP has shown that sophisticated and robust prototypes can be developed in a short period of time.\n\n"},

Instead, a good effective description of the data is provided by less basic distributions such as the negative binomial one or the probability densities of extreme value statistics. To understand this behavior from a microscopical point of view, however, no waiting time problem or extremal process need be invoked. Instead, modifying the Bernoulli random process underlying the Poissonian model to include a simple component of self-affirmation seems to describe the data surprisingly well and allows to understand the observed deviation from Gaussian statistics.

The epidemic threshold and equilibria for the model are determined and stabilities are investigated. Comprehensive qualitative analysis of the model including invariance of solutions and permanence are carried out. The epidemic threshold known as the basic reproductive number suggests that heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality influence the growth of the epidemic in HIV/AIDS affected populations and the partial reproductive number (homosexuality induced or heterosexuality and bisexuality induced) with the larger value influences the overall dynamics of the epidemic in a setting. Numerical simulations of the model show that as long as one of the partial reproductive numbers is greater than unity, the disease will exist in the population. We conclude from the study that homosexuality and bisexuality enlarge the epidemic in a heterosexual setting. The theoretical study highlights the need to carry out substantial research to map homosexuals and bisexuals as it has remained unclear as to what extent this group has contributed to the epidemic in heterosexual settings especially in southern Africa, which has remained the epidemiological locus of the epidemic.

We consider the case R=Jnnn/Jnn=1, for which the pure model is known to have a columnar ground state where rows of nearest-neighbor spins up and down alternate and undergo a weak first-order phase transition from the ordered to the paramagnetic state. With the introduction of quenched bond randomness we observe the effects signaling the expected conversion of the first-order phase transition to a second-order phase transition and using the Lee\u2013Kosterlitz method, we quantitatively verify this conversion. The emerging, under random bonds, continuous transition shows a strongly saturating specific heat behavior, corresponding to a negative exponent \u03b1, and belongs to a new distinctive universality class with \u03bd=1.135(11), \u03b3/\u03bd=1.744(9), and \u03b2/\u03bd=0.124(8). Thus, our results for the critical exponents support an extensive but weak universality and the emerged continuous transition has the same magnetic critical exponent (but a different thermal critical exponent) as a wide variety of two-dimensional (2d) systems without and with quenched disorder."},

The combination of the heavy (roughly 40kg) suit, physical exertion, and the environment in which these suits are worn can cause the wearer's temperature to rise to uncomfortable and potentially dangerous levels during missions. This paper reports on the development of a wearable wireless sensing system suitable for deployment in such manned bomb disposal missions. In its final form, the system will be capable of making in-network autonomous decisions related to the actuation of cooling within the suit, in order to increase the comfort of the wearer. In addition, it will allow an external observer to remotely monitor the health and comfort of the operative. Laboratory experiments with the instrumented suit show how skin temperature varies differently for different skin sites, motivating the need for multiple, distributed sensing. The need for timely application of in-suit cooling is also shown, as well as the importance of monitoring the overall health of the wearer of the suit. \u00a9 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."},

This approach has reoriented engine manufacturers from selling spare parts to trying to maximise each engine\u2019s longevity. This reorientation has introduced a new emphasis on sensing and monitoring. An example is the temperature sensors harness developed by Vibro Meter UK, a wholly owned subsidiary of Meggit Plc. Their thermocouple probes are able to withstand the high temperatures found within the gas stream. In principle, the large number of thermocouple sensors mounted within the engine could provide detailed thermal maps and thus provide for accurate diagnosis of potential problems before they occur. A difficulty, however, is that sending all the individual sensor data back to the control unit would require a large amount of heavy duty cabling, thus significantly increasing the weight of the engine. To avoid this, sensor values are averaged, and only a single cable is used.\nEven a single cable may be more than is necessary, however. By making use of wireless technology, low-power electronics, and advanced visualisation techniques researchers at Coventry University\u2019s Cogent Computing Applied Research Centre (CCARC), are developing a system to wirelessly connect the high temperature thermocouples and perhaps other sensors on the gas turbine engine. Furthermore, they are looking at developing visualisation tools to ensure that the much more detailed gathered data can be easily interpreted. It is hoped that the development of such a wireless sensing system will lead to several important benefits: it will reduce the weight of the engine; it will allow a detailed map of temperatures within the gas flow of the engine to be obtained; it will allow sensor faults to be detected more readily."},

The work reported here is concerned with the development of a wireless body sensor network that, as opposed to posture tracking, can: a) provide the identification and classification of eight human postures (standing, kneeling, sitting, crawling, walking, laying down on front and back, and laying on one side) in real-time and b) is able to relate this information wirelessly to a remote monitoring point. Posture information is an essential part of monitoring operatives in safety critical missions. The work sits within a larger project aiming to increase general safety of operatives in bomb disposal missions.\nThe goal of the posture body sensor network developed here is to identify the eight named postures using data from nine accelerometers placed at various sites on the human body. A prototype implementation which fulfills the goal has been produced and evaluated and is reported."},

We test the accuracy of the proposed extrapolation scheme and then apply it to study the size-shift behavior of the phase diagram of the 3D bimodal RFIM.

Their asymptotic shift-behavior yields the critical disorder strength and the associated correlation length's exponent, in agreement with previous estimates from ground-state studies of the model."},

It presents a hybrid approach based on the paradigm of Reservoir Computing. The practical applications based on recurrent spiking neurons are limited due to their non-trivial learning algorithms. In the paradigm of Reservoir Computing, instead of training the whole recurrent network only the output layer (known as readout neurons) are trained. These recurrent neural networks are termed as microcircuits which are viewed as basic computational units in cortical computation. These microcircuits are connected as columns which are linked with other neighboring columns in cortical areas. These columns read out information from each other and can serve both as reservoir and readout. The design space for this paradigm is split into three domains; front end, reservoir, and back end. This work contributes to the identification of suitable front and back end processing techniques along with stable and compact reservoir dynamics, which provides a reliable framework for classification related problems."},

This scheme produces an immense optimization of popular algorithms, such as the Wang\u2013Landau (WL) and broad histogram methods, by predicting the essential part of the energy space necessary for the estimation of the critical behavior and provides a new route of critical exponent estimation. A powerful and efficient CrMES entropic sampling scheme is proposed as an alternative to the traditional importance sampling methods. Utilizing the WL random walk process in the dominant energy subspace (CrMES-WL sampling) and using the WL approximation of the density of states and appropriate microcanonical estimators we determine the magnetic properties of the 2D Ising model. Updating energy, magnetization (E,M) histograms during the high-level WL-iterations, we provide a comprehensive alternative scheme to the Metropolis algorithm and by applying this procedure we present a convincing analysis for the far tail regime of the order-parameter probability distribution."},

This provided an opportunity for collaborative working projects to use peer-to-peer as a means of supporting this sharing of information. The use of XML opens up the prospect of processing data structures as well as whole files in a peer-to-peer environment.

Further, we extend HIV/AIDS vaccination model with condom use by incorporating treatment which allows AIDS patients to undergo amelioration. The thresholds and equilibria for the models are determined, and stabilities analyzed. The basic reproductive numbers for the models are computed and compared to assess the possible community benefits of using prophylactic vaccines, condoms and treatment with amelioration of AIDS patients. We conclude from the study that vaccination and condom use can reduce the basic reproductive number (R0) to values below unity but treatment with amelioration intended to lengthen the lives of AIDS patients may result in more numbers of HIV infections and fail to reduce R0 to values less than unity as intended for disease control. \u00a9 World Scientific Publishing Company."},

The relative entropy induces a metric, the so-called information or Fisher\u2013Rao metric, on the space of parameters and the geometrical invariants of this metric carry information about the phase structure of the model. In various models the scalar curvature, \u211b, of the information metric has been found to diverge at the phase transition point and a plausible scaling relation postulated. For spin models the necessity of calculating in non-zero field has limited analytic consideration to one-dimensional, mean-field and Bethe lattice Ising models. We extend the list somewhat in the current note by considering the one-dimensional Potts model, the two-dimensional Ising model coupled to two-dimensional quantum gravity and the three-dimensional spherical model. We note that similar ideas have been applied to elucidate possible critical behaviour in families of black hole solutions in four space-time dimensions.\n\n"},

Anthony", "author link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/rachid-anane", "abstract": "This paper presents a proactive approach to load sharing and describes the architecture of a scheme, Concert, based on this approach. A proactive approach is characterized by a shift of emphasis from reacting to load imbalance to avoiding its occurrence. In contrast, in a reactive load sharing scheme, activity is triggered when a processing node is either overloaded or underloaded. The main drawback of this approach is that a load imbalance is allowed to develop before costly corrective action is taken. Concert is a load sharing scheme for loosely-coupled distributed systems. Under this scheme, load and task behaviour information is collected and cached in advance of when it is needed. Concert uses Linux as a platform for development. Implemented partially in kernel space and partially in user space, it achieves transparency to users and applications whilst keeping the extent of kernel modifications to a minimum. Non-preemptive task transfers are used exclusively, motivated by lower complexity, lower overheads and faster transfers. The goal is to minimize the average response-time of tasks. Concert is compared with other schemes by considering the level of transparency it provides with respect to users, tasks and the underlying operating system. "},

In recent years, several prognostic markers have been used as indicators of disease progression in oncology. However, the rapid increase in the discovery of novel prognostic markers resulting from the development in medical technology, has dictated the need for developing reliable methods for extracting clinically significant markers where complex and nonlinear interactions between these markers naturally exist. The aim of this paper is to investigate the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor (FK-NN) classifier as a fuzzy logic method that provides a certainty degree for prognostic decision and assessment of the markers, and to compare it with: 1) logistic regression as a statistical method and 2) multilayer feedforward backpropagation neural networks an artificial neural-network tool, the latter two techniques having been widely used for oncological prognosis. In order to achieve this aim, breast and prostate cancer data sets are considered as benchmarks for this analysis. The overall results obtained indicate that the FK-NN-based method yields the highest predictive accuracy, and that it has produced a more reliable prognostic marker model than both the statistical and artificial neural-network-based methods."},

It is assumed that uncertainty appears in external demand. Uncertainty is propagated along the production/inventory system. Modelling of the external discrete imprecise demand is based on fuzzy sets.\nThe fuzzy model developed enables a search for the stock allocation that gives the minimum possible inventory cost of the whole serial system. The backtrack searching procedure for the most appropriate inventory stocks allocation is illustrated by an example."},

To identify those corresponding to the susceptibility we set up a numerical method involving the finite-size scaling of Lee-Yang zeroes. We also study the density of zeroes and introduce a new concept called index scaling. We apply the method to the XY model and the c]osely related step model in two dimensions. The critical parameters (including logarithmic corrections) of the step model are compatible with those of the XY model indicating that both models belong to the same universality class. This result then raises questions over how a vortex binding scenario can be the driving mechanism for the phase transition. Furthermore, the logarithmic corrections identified numerically by our methods of fitting are not in agreement with the renormalization group predictions of Kosterlitz and Thouless.\n\n"},

All three approaches rely on balancing the inertial force acting on the proof mass by electrostatic actuation, the magnitude of which provides a measure of the acceleration signal.

For the one-dimensional Ising model the scalar curvature, Script R, of this metric can be calculated explicitly in the thermodynamic limit and is found to be Script R = 1 + cosh(h)/\u221asinh2(h) + exp(\u22124\u03b2). This is positive definite and, for physical fields and temperatures, diverges only at the zero-temperature, zero-field 'critical point' of the model. In this paper we calculate Script R for the one-dimensional q-state Potts model finding an expression of the form Script R = A(q, \u03b2, h) + B(q, \u03b2, h)/\u221a\u03b7(q, \u03b2, h), where \u03b7(q, \u03b2, h) is the Potts analogue of sinh2(h) + exp(\u22124\u03b2). This is no longer positive definite, but once again it diverges only at the critical point in the space of real parameters. We remark, however, that a naive analytic continuation to complex field reveals a further divergence in the Ising and Potts curvatures at the Lee\u2013Yang edge."},

The data used for the survival analysis were collected from 100 women who had been clinically diagnosed with breast disease in the form of carcinoma or benign conditions. The data set consists of seven different histological and cytological prognostic factors and two corresponding outputs to be predicted (whether the patient is alive or dead within 5 years of diagnosis). The MLFFBPNN, FK-NN and LR based indices identified different subsets of the factors as the most significant sets. We therefore suggest that it could be dangerous to rely on one method's outcome for assessment of such factors. It should also be noted that \"S-phase fraction\" (SPF) is the common cytological factor identified by all three methods while none of the three methods identified another cytological factor, namely \"minimum (start) nuclear pleomorphism index\" (NPImin). We, therefore, conclude that \"S-phase fraction\" and \"minimum (start) nuclear pleomorphism index\" appear to be the most and least important prognostic factors, respectively, for survival analysis in breast cancer patients, and should be investigated thoroughly in future clinical studies in oncology."},

This explains the applicability of the Lee\u2013Yang theory of partition function zeros to the ASEP normalization.\n\nIn this paper we consider the exact solution of the parallel-update ASEP, a special case of the Nagel\u2013Schreckenberg model for traffic flow, in which the ASEP phase transitions can be interpreted as jamming transitions, and find that Lee\u2013Yang theory still applies. We show that the parallel-update ASEP normalization can be expressed as one of several equivalent two-dimensional lattice path problems involving weighted Dyck or Motzkin paths. We introduce the notion of thermodynamic equivalence for such paths and show that the robustness of the general form of the ASEP phase diagram under various update dynamics is a consequence of this thermodynamic equivalence.\n\n"},

The method, presented in an algorithmic approach, is based on a very simple idea, familiar in statistical mechanics from the notion of thermodynamic equivalence of ensembles and the central limit theorem. It is illustrated that we can predict with high accuracy the critical part of the energy space and by using this restricted part we can extend our simulations to larger systems and improve the accuracy of critical parameters. It is proposed that the extensions of the finite-size critical part of the energy space, determining the specific heat, satisfy a scaling law involving the thermal critical exponent. The method is applied successfully for the estimation of the scaling behavior of specific heat of both square and simple cubic Ising lattices. The proposed scaling law is verified by estimating the thermal critical exponent from the finite-size behavior of the critical part of the energy space. The density of states of the zero-field Ising model on these lattices is obtained via a multirange Wang-Landau sampling."},

In view of the notorious problems of clearly resolving the Kosterlitz\u2013Thouless scenario in the two-dimensional XY model numerically, the F model in particular constitutes an instructive reference case for the simulational description of this type of phase transition.

RFID is an automatic identification technology whereby digital data encoded in a transponder is captured by a reader using radio waves. The communication process between the transponder and the reader involves the transmitting of energy by the reader's antenna, which is picked up by transponder's antenna and some of it reflected back using backscattering modulation. Nonetheless RFID is still a relatively immature technology and many of its characteristics in real-life industrial scenarios are not yet fully understood. For example, the performance of RFID can be severely hampered by the presence of metals and liquids in the tagged product or extreme conditions in the environment. Hence it is important to examine the practical feasibility of RFID in harsher surroundings. This research is an attempt to examine the practical issues associated with using RFID in a complex metal environment and the interference of RF waves caused by metals in particular. The work also highlights various methods which when applied can improve the performance of RFID significantly"},

This enables a thorough reinvestigation of the long-standing questions of (i) extensive degeneracy of the ground state and (ii) a possible decoupling of spin and chiral degrees of freedom in such systems.

While the influence of such connectivity disorder is rather mild for ferromagnets in that an ordered phase persists and only the properties of the phase transition are substantially changed in some cases, any finite-temperature transition is wiped out due to frustration for some of the antiferromagnetic models. A wealth of different phenomena is observed: While for the annealed average of quantum gravity some graphs can adapt dynamically to allow the emergence of a N\u00e9el ordered phase, this is not possible for the quenched average, where a zero-temperature spin-glass phase appears instead. We relate the latter to the behavior of conventional spin-glass models coupled to random graphs."},

The model is formulated using integro-differential equations, which are shown to be equivalent to delay differential equations with delay due to incubation period. The threshold and equilibria for the model are determined and stabilities are examined. We extend the model to incorporate the effects of condom use as another preventive strategy for controlling HIV/AIDS. Basic reproductive numbers for these models are computed and compared to assess the effectiveness of male circumcision and condom use in a community. The models are numerically analysed to assess the effects of the two preventive strategies on the transmission dynamics of HIV/AIDS. We conclude from the study that in the continuing absence of a preventive vaccine or cure for HIV/AIDS, male circumcision is a potential effective preventive strategy of HIV/AIDS to help communities slow the development of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and that it is even more effective if implemented jointly with condom use. The study provides insights into the possible community benefits that male circumcision and condom use as preventive strategies provide in slowing or curtailing the HIV/AIDS epidemic. \u00a9 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Owing to the specific structure of local (free) energy minima, general-purpose optimization strategies perform relatively poorly on these problems, and a number of specially tailored optimization techniques have been developed in particular for the Ising spin glass and similar discrete systems. Here, an efficient optimization heuristic for the much less discussed case of continuous spins is introduced, based on the combination of an embedding of Ising spins into the continuous rotators and an appropriate variant of a genetic algorithm. Statistical techniques for insuring high reliability in finding (numerically) exact ground states are discussed, and the method is benchmarked against the simulated annealing approach."},

Important aspects of the existing theories of first-order transitions are briefly reviewed, tested on this model, and compared with previous work on the Potts model. Using lattices with linear sizes L=30,40,\u2026,100,120,140,160,200,240,360 and 480 we estimate the thermal characteristics of the present weak first-order transition. Our results improve the original estimates of Rastelli et al. and verify all the generally accepted predictions of the finite-size scaling theory of first-order transitions, including transition point shifts, thermal, and magnetic anomalies. However, two of our findings are not compatible with current phenomenological expectations. The behavior of transition points, derived from the number-of-phases parameter, is not in accordance with the theoretically conjectured exponentially small shift behavior and the well-known double Gaussian approximation does not correctly describe higher correction terms of the energy cumulants. It is argued that this discrepancy has its origin in the commonly neglected contributions from domain wall corrections."},

This paper presents a small (component volume 0.1 cm3, practical volume 0.15 cm3) electromagnetic generator utilizing discrete components and optimized for a low ambient vibration level based upon real application data. The generator uses four magnets arranged on an etched cantilever with a wound coil located within the moving magnetic field. Magnet size and coil properties were optimized, with the final device producing 46 \u00b5W in a resistive load of 4 k\u03a9 from just 0.59 m s\u22122 acceleration levels at its resonant frequency of 52 Hz. A voltage of 428 mVrms was obtained from the generator with a 2300 turn coil which has proved sufficient for subsequent rectification and voltage step-up circuitry. The generator delivers 30% of the power supplied from the environment to useful electrical power in the load. This generator compares very favourably with other demonstrated examples in the literature, both in terms of normalized power density and efficiency."},

In principle, the nature of an occurring spin-glass phase in such systems might be inferred from an analysis of the zero-temperature properties. Unfortunately, with few exceptions, the problem of finding ground-state configurations is a nonpolynomial problem computationally, such that efficient approximation algorithms are called for. Here, we employ the recently developed genetic embedded matching (GEM) heuristic to investigate the nature of the zero-temperature phase of the bimodal XY spin glass in two dimensions. We analyze bulk properties such as the asymptotic ground-state energy and the phase diagram of disorder strength vs disorder concentration. For the case of a symmetric distribution of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds, we find that the ground state of the model is unique up to a global O(2) rotation of the spins. In particular, there are no extensive degeneracies in this model. The main focus of this work is on an investigation of the excitation spectrum as probed by changing the boundary conditions. Using appropriate finite-size scaling techniques, we consistently determine the stiffness of spin and chiral domain walls and the corresponding fractal dimensions. Most noteworthy, we find that the spin and chiral channels are characterized by two distinct stiffness exponents and, consequently, the system displays spin-chirality decoupling at large length scales. Results for the overlap distribution do not support the possibility of a multitude of thermodynamic pure states."},

It is imperative to provide service consumers with facilities for selecting required web services according to their non-functional characteristics or quality of service (QoS). However, the selection process is greatly complicated by the distinct views of service providers and consumers on the services QoS. For instance, they may have distinct views of the service reliability\u2014wherein a consumer considers that a service is reliable if its success rate is higher than 99%, while a provider may consider its service as reliable if its success rate is higher than 90%. The aim of this paper is to resolve such conflicts and to ensure consensus on the QoS characteristics in the selection of web services. It proposes a QoS Consensus Moderation Approach (QCMA) in order to perform QoS consensus and to alleviate the differences on QoS characteristics in the selection of web services. The proposed approach is implemented as a prototype tool and is tested on a case study of a hotel booking web service. Experimental results show that the proposed approach greatly improves the service selection process in a dynamic and uncertain environment of web services."},

Another issue that is addressed is how competing risks arise in reliability and maintenance analysis through the ways in which data is censored. Mixture failure rate modeling is also a point of discussion, as well as the signature of systems, where the properties of the system through the signature from the probability distributions on the lifetime of the components are distinguished.

Phase transition temperatures, thermal and magnetic critical exponents are determined for lattice sizes in the range L=20\u2013100 via a sophisticated two-stage numerical strategy of entropic sampling in dominant energy subspaces, using mainly the Wang-Landau algorithm. The second-order phase transition, emerging under random bonds from the second-order regime of the pure model, has the same values of critical exponents as the two-dimensional Ising universality class, with the effect of the bond disorder on the specific heat being well described by double-logarithmic corrections, our findings thus supporting the marginal irrelevance of quenched bond randomness. On the other hand, the second-order transition, emerging under bond randomness from the first-order regime of the pure model, has a distinctive universality class with \u03bd=1.30(6) and \u03b2\u2215\u03bd=0.128(5). These results amount to a strong violation of universality principle of critical phenomena, since these two second-order transitions, with different sets of critical exponents, are between the same ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. Furthermore, the latter of these two sets of results supports an extensive but weak universality, since it has the same magnetic critical exponent (but a different thermal critical exponent) as a wide variety of two-dimensional systems with and without quenched disorder. In the conversion by bond randomness of the first-order transition of the pure system to second order, we detect, by introducing and evaluating connectivity spin densities, a microsegregation that also explains the increase we find in the phase transition temperature under bond randomness."},

The second-order phase transition, emerging under random bonds from the second-order regime of the pure model, has the same values of critical exponents as the 2d Ising universality class, with the effect of the bond disorder on the specific heat being well described by double-logarithmic corrections. On the other hand, the second-order transition, emerging under bond randomness from the first-order regime of the pure model, has a distinctive universality class with v=1.30(6) and \u03b2/v=0.128(5). These results amount to a strong violation of universality principle of critical phenomena, since these two second-order transitions, with different sets of critical exponents, are between the same ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. Furthermore, the latter of these two sets of results supports an extensive but weak universality, since it has the same magnetic critical exponent (but a different thermal critical exponent) as a wide variety of 2d systems with and without quenched disorder.\n\n"},

An important problem for the performance of the Virtual Organization is distributing the agents across the computational resources so that the system achieves a good load balancing. In this paper, a solution for the agent distribution across hosts in an agent-based Virtual Organization is proposed. The solution is based on a genetic algorithm that is meant to be applied just after the formation of the Virtual Organization. The developed genetic strategy uses an elitist crossover operator where one of the children inherits the most promising genetic material from the parents with higher probability. This proposal differs from current works since it takes into account load balancing, software requirements of the agents and trust issues. In order to validate the proposal, the designed genetic algorithm has been succesfully compared to different heuristic methods that solve the same addresed problem."},

Our simulations are carried out for large ensembles of disorder realizations and lattices with linear sizes L in the range L=8\u221264L=8\u221264. We apply well-established finite-size scaling techniques and concepts from the scaling theory of disordered systems to describe the nature of the phase transition of the disordered model, departing gradually from the fixed point of the pure system. Our analysis (based on the determination of the critical exponents) shows that the 3D random-bond Ising model belongs to the same universality class with the site- and bond-dilution models, providing a single universality class for the 3D Ising model with these three types of quenched uncorrelated disorder."},

It is argued that the effective design of an e-voting system and its viability can be enhanced by a two-pronged approach to robustness. First, it requires a clear distinction between two forms of robustness: robustness at protocol level and robustness at system level. Second, selected technologies should be integrated into an appropriate architecture in order to address robustness simultaneously at the two levels. The proposed approach is illustrated by the design and implementation of an e-voting system based on the FOO92 protocol. A service-oriented architecture supported by onion routing forms the basis of the system. It facilitates the distribution of tasks and state, the dynamic path configuration and the just-in-time (JIT) composition of the election system. The system conforms to most e-voting requirements."},

We identify the three following regimes where: i) full microphase separation between blocks of different type occurs (all blocks of A-type monomers form a single cluster, while all blocks of B-type monomers form another); ii) full microphase separation is observed with a certain probability; and iii) full microphase separation cannot take place.

The main novelty of this article stems from the utilization of a gradient based adaptive scheme that is able to adapt the controller's gain ruling the rising and settling time of the robot and up to now has been ad-hoc selected. The proposed adaptation scheme is based on the robot's path tracking errors and is able to provide an on-line adjustment for the performance improvement, independently of the selected path type. Multiple experimental test cases, including the movement of the robot on various path profiles, prove the efficacy of the proposed scheme."},

In this paper, a simple deterministic HIV/AIDS model incorporating condom use, sexual partner acquisition, behavior change and treatment as HIV/AIDS control strategies is formulated using a system of ordinary differential equations with the object of applying it to the current South African situation. Firstly, a theoretical analysis of the model is presented. The analysis of the model shows that the disease free equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable for the epidemic threshold R (the model reproduction number) less than unit and unstable when this threshold is greater than unit. A unique endemic equilibrium, whose local stability near the threshold R, is determined using the center manifold theory, is shown to be locally asymptotically stable for R>1. Global stability of the endemic equilibrium is shown for a special case whenever R>1. Secondly, the model is fitted to data from UNAIDS/WHO on HIV/AIDS in South Africa. Based on the fit to the prevalence data, projections are made beyond 2007 on the course of the epidemic for various levels of interventions. The results compare very well with other research outcomes on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa. Projections are made to track the changes in the number of individuals who will be under treatment, an important group as far as public health planning is concerned. The epidemiological implications of such projections on public health planning and management are discussed."},

The model relies on a trusted mediator that coordinates and helps team members in the decisions that they have to take during the negotiation process: which offer is sent to the opponent, and whether the offers received from the opponent are accepted. The main strength of the proposed negotiation model is the fact that it guarantees unanimity within team decisions since decisions report a utility to team members that is greater than or equal to their aspiration levels at each negotiation round. This work analyzes how unanimous decisions are taken within the team and the robustness of the model against different types of manipulations.

The system is studied numerically in both its first- and second-order phase-transition regimes by a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis for a particularly suitable value of the disorder strength. We find that our data for the second-order phase transition, emerging under random bonds from the second-order regime of the pure model, are compatible with the universality class of the two-dimensional (2D) random Ising model. Furthermore, we find evidence that, the second-order transition emerging under bond randomness from the first-order regime of the pure model, belongs again to the same universality class. Although the first finding reinforces the scenario of strong universality in the 2D Ising model with quenched disorder, the second is in difference from the critical behavior, emerging under randomness, in the cases of the ex-first-order transitions of the Potts model. Finally, our results verify previous renormalization-group calculations on the Blume-Capel model with disorder in the crystal-field coupling."},

In this paper we present the first attempt to provide a computational model which takes into account cultural factors in a team negotiation setting. The model considers how two important cultural dimensions, power distance and individualism/collectivism, affect team negotiation dynamics and negotiation outcomes.

We find, in particular, that the anisotropy of the NLC coating does not affect much the (isotropic) optical response of the NP. However, for strong anchoring of the NLC molecules on the surface of NP, the inhomogeneity of the coating which is manifested by a ring-type singularity (disclination or Saturn ring), produces an enhancement of the extinction cross spectrum over the entire visible spectrum."},

First, encryption strength is adjusted according to the severity of the requested service. This helps save energy, while preserving the encryption strength. Second, for battery-powered devices, data can be encrypted according to a specified threshold, or even based on the battery level itself. The reliability function, which is the backbone of the proposed adaptive security scheme, serves as a quality factor that describes all encryption parameters and their impact on energy consumption and therefore as a global indicator of the overall security with respect to the energy consumption."},

The role of warning dissemination is a key part in the success of such large-scale evacuations and its inadequacy in certain cases has been a \u2018primary contribution to deaths and injuries\u2019 (Hayden et al., 2007). Along with technology-driven \u2018official warning channels\u2019 (e.g. sirens, mass media), the role of unofficial channel (e.g. neighbours, personal contacts, volunteer wardens) has proven to be significant in warning the public of the need to evacuate. Although post-evacuation studies identify the behaviours of evacuees as disseminators of the warning message, there has not been a detailed study that quantifies the effects of such behaviour on the warning message dissemination. This paper develops an Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) model of multiple agents (evacuee households) in a hypothetical community to investigate the impact of behaviour as an unofficial channel on the overall warning dissemination. Parameters studied include the percentage of people who warn their neighbours, the efficiency of different official warning channels, and delay time to warn neighbours. Even with a low proportion of people willing to warn their neighbour, the results showed considerable impact on the overall warning dissemination."},

Proper modeling of such systems frequently requires the construction of ensembles of digraphs with a given sequence of in- and out-degrees. As the number of simple labeled graphs with a given degree sequence is typically very large even for short sequences, sampling methods are needed for statistical studies. Currently, there are two main classes of methods that generate samples. One of the existing methods first generates a restricted class of graphs, then uses a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm based on edge swaps to generate other realizations. As the mixing time of this process is still unknown, the independence of the samples is not well controlled. The other class of methods is based on the Configuration Model that may lead to unacceptably many sample rejections due to self-loops and multiple edges. Here we present an algorithm that can directly construct all possible realizations of a given bi-degree sequence by simple digraphs. Our method is rejection free, guarantees the independence of the constructed samples, and provides their weight. The weights can then be used to compute statistical averages of network observables as if they were obtained from uniformly distributed sampling, or from any other chosen distribution. "},

The main purpose is to study the sensitivity of the system availability with respect to the changes in the main parameters. In the simplest case that the failure repair process is (continuous time/discrete state) Markovian, explicit formulae are well known. Unfortunately, in more general cases availability is often a complicated function of the parameters without closed form solution. Thus, the computation of sensitivity measures would be time-consuming or even infeasible."},

When considering Algebraic Petri nets (APNs) for modeling and model checking for verification, all the proofs must be redone after each iteration which is impractical both in terms of time and space. In this work, we introduce an Algebraic Petri net slicing technique that optimizes the model checking of static or structurally evolving APN models. Furthermore, our approach is proposing a classification of evolutions dedicated to the improvement of model checking."},

The contribution of this paper is to propose a framework for the reduction of test input data generated by a formal testing approach based on X-Machines. To achieve these objectives we have applied a well known statistical approach called Random Cluster Sampling on the test case set generated by a formal approach X-Machines. To exemplify our technique we have generated a test set for an X-Machine Microwave oven specification and then drew a sample from the test set by using the Random Cluster sampling technique. Based on the tolerated fault rate we have extracted conclusion about the accuracy of implementation."},

Firstly, the identification of the functional components designed to facilitate security through authentication and nonrepudiation, and those aimed at insuring trust; secondly, their implementation and integration into a hybrid P2P architecture, where the entry point server plays a central role. This integration is facilitated by the layering of functional components. Secure and trusted file transactions are further enhanced by a community management layer. "},

We have now explored operating schemes to provide accurate short pulses of high radiance light in an intensity modulation scheme for the purpose of retinal prosthesis.

The 262 MHz one-port SAWR operates in a grounded-base Colpitts oscillator arrangement that was developed based on an equivalent circuit model. Electrical characteristics of the fabricated SAWR show good agreement with its equivalent device model at the resonant frequencies, and it was found to have good stability and sensitivity with a Q-factor in air of about 2,870 at its fundamental resonant frequency. The sensor system is designed to operate in a dual configuration in which one resonator is coated with a gas- sensitive polymer (polyethylene) coating, whilst the second one is used as a reference channel; thereby eliminating common mode interferences on the baseline signal. Mass sensitivity was found to be ca. 1 Hz/ng, which corresponds to sub-ppm sensitivity to gas/odour concentration."},

This can be overcome by using geospatial interpolation techniques that provide a complete coverage of the levels of pollutants. The aim of this study is to locate sample points, characterise distribution patterns, map air pollutant distributions using interpolation techniques, highlight areas exceeding standard levels and in doing so determine spatial and temporal patterns of the levels of air pollutants.

From a review of existing SG evaluation criteria, we define a tailored set of criteria for energy SG development and evaluation. The criteria emphasise the need for the game to increase energy literacy through applicability to real-life energy use/management; clear, actionable goals and feedback; ways of comparing usage socially and personal relevance. Three existing energy games are evaluated according to this framework. The paper concludes by outlining directions for future development of SGs as an effective tool in social science research, including games which inspire reflection on trade-offs and usage at different scales.\n\n"},

However, there is no research on performance models for the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Due to the complexity of HDFS and the difficulty of modeling the multiple impact factors for HDFS performance, to establish HDFS performance models based directly on these impact factors is very complicated. In this paper, the relationship between file size and HDFS Write/Read (denoted as W/R for short) throughput, i.e., the average flow rate of a HDFS W/R operation, is studied to build HDFS performance models from a systematic view. Based on the measured data of specially designed experiments (in which HDFS W/R operations can be viewed as single-input single-output systems), a system identification-based approach is applied to construct performance models for HDFS W/R operations under different conditions. Furthermore, dynamic characteristics metrics for HDFS performance are defined, and based on the identified performance models and these metrics, the dynamic characteristics of HDFS W/R operations, such as steady state and overshoot, are studied, and the relationships between impact factors and dynamic characteristics are analyzed. These analysis results can provide effective guidance and implications for the design and configuration of HDFS and Hadoop-based applications."},

However, both the marketplace and career paths are becoming increasingly dynamic, with employees more frequently moving between sectors and positions than was the case for previous generations. The concept of a \u201cjob for life\u201d at a single organization is becoming less prevalent across sectors and cultures. In such a context, traditional approaches to career guidance, which often focused upon identifying a suitable occupation for adolescents at an early stage and establishing a route towards it, are being challenged with the need to communicate the value of transferrable skills and non-linear progression paths. This article explores the role digital games might play in allowing learners to develop these skills as part of a wider careers guidance programme. Through a case study of the \u201cMeTycoon\u201d serious game, the potential reach of such games is discussed, with 38,097 visits to the game's website, and 408,247 views of embedded educational videos.

The purpose of these games is to enable the generation of predictive behavioural models, and thus design an adaptive and dynamic game promoting responsible energy consumption. Adapting the behaviour of energy consumers to follow environmentally friendly consumption patterns is a central challenge when seeking to address environmental concerns. To perform such adaptation, an understanding of an individual user's traits can allow for customised solutions to be delivered, increasing the likelihood of impact. To assess the usability of the games, domain experts filled in two QUIS questionnaires. The results showed a broadly positive reception of the games' usability; taking into account time, financial and other resources, though they also highlight some areas for future work.. More broadly, knowledge generated has the potential to inform designs of similar games that adapt behavioural tasks to elicit an understanding of the user."},

A series of comfort trials were performed ranging from controlled indoor trials to on-road driving trials. The outputs of all four models were compared to the sensation index reported by the subjects situated in the driver seat. The results show that PMV and Nilsson's model are generally applicable for the car cabin environment, but that they are most accurate when there is a small air temperature rate of change (of under 1.5 \u00b0C per minute), giving correlation levels of 0.91 and 0.93 for the two models respectively. Taniguchi's and Zhang's models were found unsuitable for all conditions, with correlation levels ranging between 0.03 and 0.60. Nilsson's model is recommended by the authors based on the level of agreement with the subjective reports, its ability to estimate both local and overall thermal sensation and the smaller number of input parameters."},

In the warning dissemination phase, uncertainty in the household?s behaviour as ?warning informants? has been investigated along with uncertainties in the warning system. An agentbased model (ABM) was developed for ESF-1 with households as agents and ?warning informants? behaviour as the agent behaviour. The model was used to study warning dissemination effectiveness under various conditions of the official channel. In the transportation phase, uncertainties in the household?s behaviour such as departure time (a function of ESF-1), means of transport and destination have been. Households could evacuate as pedestrians, using car or evacuation buses. An ABM was developed to study the evacuation performance (measured in evacuation travel time). In this thesis, a holistic approach for planning the public evacuation shelters called ?Shelter Information Management System? (SIMS) has been developed. A generic allocation framework of was developed to available shelter capacity to the shelter demand by considering the evacuation travel time. This was formulated using integer programming. In the sheltering phase, the uncertainty in household shelter choices (either nearest/allocated/convenient) has been studied for its impact on allocation policies using sensitivity analyses. Using analyses from the models and detailed examination of household states from ?warning to safety?, it was found that the three ESFs though sequential in time, however have lot of interdependencies from the perspective of evacuation planning. This thesis has illustrated an OR/MS based integrated approach including and beyond single ESF preparedness. The developed approach will help in understanding the inter-linkages of the three evacuation phases and preparing a multi-agency-based evacuation planning evacuation"},

It builds on the fact that TD-conj was proven to be equivalent to a gradient TD method with a variable lambda under certain conditions. Based on straightforward features extraction process combined with goal-aware capabilities provided by whole image measure, the model solves what we call u-turn-homing benchmark problem without using landmarks. Only one goal snapshot was used with agent facing the goal directly. Therefore a novel threshold stopping formula was used to recognize the goal which is less sensitive to the agent-goal orientation problem. Unlike other models, this model refrains from artificially manipulating or assuming a priori knowledge about the environment, two constraints that widely restrict the applicability of existing models in realistic scenarios. An on-line control method was used to train a set of neural networks. With the aid of variable and fixed eligibility traces, these networks approximate the agent\u2019s action-value function allowing it to take close to optimal actions to reach its home. The effectiveness of the model was experimentally verified on an agent.\n\n"},

This paper presents an evaluation of a game-based approach seeking to improve the road safety behaviour amongst children aged 9-15 within the UK, made available outside of a classroom context as an online, browser-based, free-to-play game. The paper reports on data for 99,683 players over 315,882 discrete logins, supplemented by results from a nationally-representative survey of children at UK schools (n=1,108), an incentivized survey of the player-base (n=1,028), and qualitative data obtained through a series of one-to-one interviews aged 9-14 (n=28). Analysis demonstrates the reach of the game to its target demographic, with 88.13% of players within the UK. A 3.94 male/female ratio was observed amongst players surveyed, with an age distribution across the target range of 9-15. Noting mean and median playtimes of 93 and 31 minutes (n=99,683), it is suggested such an approach to user engagement and retention can surpass typical contact times obtained through other forms of web-based content. The size of the player-base attracted to the game and players' qualitative feedback demonstrates the potential for serious games deployed on a national scale.\n\n"},

In the case of binary erasure channels (BECs), certain error-prone patterns, known as stopping sets, are proven to cause this performance degradation. A possible approach to diminish this drawback over BECs is to eliminate stopping sets by parity-check matrix extension. Given a parity-check matrix H, and a list L of its stopping sets, we present an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation to find a parity-check equation which eliminates the maximum number of stopping sets in L. One of the distinguishing advantages of the proposed scheme is its flexibility for modifications such as: limiting the weight of the new parity-check row, making the new row redundant or linearly independent, 4-cycle avoidance, and taking into account the sizes of stopping sets. Armed with these adjustments, the method can provide good performance improvements, as evidenced by simulation results. Furthermore, for a given \u2208 N, by extending the basic formulation, we provide an ILP formulation for finding a set of size of parity-check equations which can best eliminate the stopping sets in L, among all such sets.

In view of the dynamic nature of data centers, we propose a stochastic model based on Queueing theory to capture the main characteristics.

Thus, they might pose new threats to high-elevation ecosystems, which are often of high conservation value. Current range predictions are primarily based on climate niche models, however many other factors might also contribute to the species' distribution. \n\nWe studied the species-specific elevational limits of one native (Impatiens noli-tangere) and two invasive balsams (Impatiens glandulifera and Impatiens parviflora) on a mid-mountain range in Germany. We used a combination of trait measurements and a field experiment to assess the relative importance of temperature, trait adaptations, and biotic interactions on elevational limits. \n\nResults indicate that concurrent seedling emergence, low frost resistance and, for I. glandulifera, late flowering, are important contributors to elevational limits. Because of a lack of seed bank persistence, erratic spring and autumn frost events coinciding with the plants' annual life-cycles will likely influence the upper limits of the invasive species. The abundance of the species seems to be further limited by herbivory, mainly by molluscs. \n\nGiven that a highly nuanced interaction between phenological development and erratic frost events are important for range limits, predictions based solely on mean climatic values, such as temperature, are unlikely to accurately predict future invasion limits. \n\nOur results indicate that occasional occurrences of the species do not necessarily call for eradication actions, that management efforts might be most effective at intermediate elevations, and that any measure encouraging terrestrial molluscs will help to maintain biotic resistance."},

However, such schemes determine the degree of QoS satisfaction using fuzzy set membership functions, and cannot therefore take negative evidence (i.e., consumer dissatisfaction) into account. By contrast, vague sets provide the ability to represent both positive and negative evidence when modeling uncertain objects. Accordingly, the present study proposes a new satisfaction-based Web service ranking method for QSDS problems involving a group of online service consumers with imprecise and inconsistent expectations and degrees of satisfaction regarding multiple QoS criteria. Importantly, the proposed approach overcomes the uncertainty regarding the difference between the users\u2019 expectations and their degree of satisfaction inherent in Dempster\u2013Shafer (D-S) evidence theory. Overall, the results show that the proposed scheme provides an effective means of solving the problem of vague and ill-defined information in the QSDS decision-making process."},

Berche", "author link": "https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/ralph-kenna", "abstract": "In the 1960's, four famous scaling relations were developed which relate the six standard critical exponents describing continuous phase transitions in the thermodynamic limit of statistical physics models. They are well understood at a fundamental level through the renormalization group. They have been verified in multitudes of theoretical, computational and experimental studies and are firmly established and profoundly important for our understanding of critical phenomena. One of the scaling relations, hyperscaling, fails above the upper critical dimension. There, critical phenomena are governed by Gaussian fixed points in the renormalization-group formalism. Dangerous irrelevant variables are required to deliver the mean-field and Landau values of the critical exponents, which are deemed valid by the Ginzburg criterion. Also above the upper critical dimension, the standard picture is that, unlike for low-dimensional systems, finite-size scaling is non-universal, at least at the critical point. Here we report on new developments which indicate that the current paradigm is flawed and incomplete. In particular, the introduction of a new exponent characterising the finite-size correlation length allows one to extend hyperscaling beyond the upper critical dimension. Moreover, finite-size scaling is shown to be universal provided the correct scaling window is chosen. These recent developments above the upper critical dimension also lead to the introduction of a new scaling relation analogous to one introduced by Fisher 50 years ago and deliver a statistical physics explanation for the emergence of effective four dimensionality as characteristic of generic field theories."},

Hence, this review analyzes heat transfer mechanisms during the phase-change process and numerical analysis for heat transfer in macroencapsulated PCMs according to the shape of containment. The effective heat capacity method and the enthalpy method, two of the most widely used numerical approaches for phase-change problems, are presented in detail.

However, in these attempts, a choice function is completely specified. That is, given any subset of options, called an issue, the best option over that issue is always known, whilst in real-world scenarios, it is very often that only a few choices are known instead of all. In this paper, we study partial choice functions and investigate necessary and sufficient rationality conditions for situations where only a few choices are known. We prove that our necessary and sufficient condition for partial choice functions boils down to the necessary and sufficient conditions for complete choice functions proposed in the literature. Choice functions have been instrumental in belief revision theory. That is, in most approaches to belief revision, the problem studied can simply be described as the choice of possible worlds compatible with the input information, given an agent\u2019s prior belief state. The main effort has been to devise strategies in order to infer the agents revised belief state. Our study considers the converse problem: given a collection of input information items and their corresponding revision results (as provided by an agent), does there exist a rational revision operation used by the agent and a consistent belief state that may explain the observed results?"},

We first derive a laminar solution for the inviscid equations of motion under the assumption of uniform vorticity flow. This solution exhibits a res- onance if the libration frequency matches the frequency of the spin-over inertial mode. Furthermore, we extend our model by introducing a reduced model of the effect of viscous Ekman layers in the limit of low Ekman number (Noir and C\\'ebron 2013). This theoretical approach is consistent with the results of Chan et al. (2011) and Zhang et al. (2012) for spheroidal geometries. Our results are validated against systematic three-dimensional numerical simulations. In the second part of the paper, we present the first linear sta- bility analysis of this uniform vorticity flow. To this end, we adopt different methods (Lifschitz and Hameiri 1991; Gledzer and Ponomarev 1977) that allow to deduce upper and lower bounds for the growth rate of an instability. Our analysis shows that the uniform vorticity base flow is prone to inertial instabilities caused by a parametric resonance mechanism. This is confirmed by a set of direct numerical simulations. Applying our results to planetary settings, we find that neither a spin-over resonance nor an inertial instability can exist within the liquid core of the Moon, Io and Mercury."},

We have designed a real network to present experiments that use a Snort NIDPS. Our experiments demonstrate the weaknesses of NIDPSs, such as inability to process multiple packets and propensity to drop packets in heavy traffic and high-speed networks without analysing them. We tested Snort's analysis performance, gauging the number of packets sent, analysed, dropped, filtered, injected, and outstanding. We suggest using QoS configuration technologies in a Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series Switch and parallel Snorts to improve NIDPS performance and to reduce the number of dropped packets. Our results show that our novel configuration improves performance.\n\n"},

This paper proposes a new classification technique based on the IWO algorithm, called the invasive weed classification (IWC), to face the problem of pattern classification for multi-class datasets. The aim of the IWC is to find the set of the positions of the class centers that minimize the multi-objective function, i.e., the optimal positions of the class centers. The classification performance is computed as the percentage of misclassified patterns in the testing dataset achieved by the best plants in terms of fitness performance. The performance of the IWC algorithm, both in terms of classification accuracy and training time, is compared with other commonly used classification algorithms.\n\n"},

Most progress has been made in arid and semi-arid climates for use in high value crop production where irrigation costs coupled with concerns regarding water scarcity have stimulated PI innovation and development. In temperate and humid climates where irrigation is supplemental to rainfall, PI is less developed but nevertheless offers scope to make more effective use of rainfall, help reduce the non-beneficial losses associated with irrigation (deep drainage, nitrate leaching) and provide farmers with evidence to demonstrate environmentally sustainable practices to processors and retailers. This paper reports on recent experiences in developing precision irrigation in UK field-scale agriculture, drawing on evidence from field research and modelling studies. By combining data from these sources, a critical evaluation focusing on selected technical, agronomic and engineering challenges that need to be overcome are described, including issues regarding PI scheduling, and the delineation of irrigation management zones to ensure compatibility with existing methods of overhead irrigation. The findings have relevance to other countries where irrigation is supplemental and where precision agriculture is gaining popularity."},

It is found that when the latent heat increases from 70 to 170 kJ/kg, the melting time is increased by 103% and freezing time is prolonged by 60%. If heat flux is increased by 33%, the melting time is reduced by 36.4%. Increasing thermal conductivity of the insulation material from 0.02 to 0.06 W/m K, the melting time is prolonged by 47.2%. When absorptivity of the absorber is increased from 0.8 to 1.0, the melting time is decreased by 26.3%. When transmissivity of the glass cover is increased by 25%, the melting time is reduced by 26.7%. For the inlet air temperature, when it decreases from 25 to 15 \u00b0C, the freezing time is shortened by 39%. The melting time is only reduced by 8% when thermal conductivity of the absorber is increased by 25 times. Therefore, it can be concluded that the first six parameters have more impact on the system's performance. While the thermal conductivity of absorber slightly impacts it.\n\n"},

In this paper, we propose a topic community-based method via nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). This method first applies joint NMF model to mine topic community existing in OSN by combing link and content information. Then it makes friend recommendation based on topic community. Experiments show that our method can reflect user preferences on friend selection more appropriately and has better recommendation performance than traditional methods. Moreover, our application case also demonstrates that it can obviously improve friend recommendation service in the real world OSN.\n\n"},

Using the results from an online survey we try to explore the relationships of the Affective Trajectories basic elements, namely one's current affective state, prediction of the future, and experienced outcomes following this prediction, with a set of education related emotions. The relations of these elements with flow, excitement, calm, boredom, stress, confusion, frustration and neutral linguistic emotional labels are presented and discussed. Their predictive power is evaluated by using these elements as inputs to different classification systems, and observing their performance in mapping different combinations of those elements to specific emotion labels. A data-driven fuzzy approach is utilized in order to linguistically model the underlying relations between the emotions, and the basic elements, by creating easily interpretable fuzzy rule bases. In our research we suggest that the basic elements are combined in a personalized way in order for an individual to choose a specific emotion label to describe his affective state. For this reason a fuzzy adaptive approach is also implemented, in order to demonstrate the importance of individual differences in this process, and the benefits of having a personalized system that can perpetuate modelling of emotional trajectories over learning tasks. Finally an overview and a basic implementation of an affective computing system which uses these elements are presented, and future research directions discussed.\n\n"},

The electric boundary conditions correspond to Hunt's flow with perfectly insulating walls parallel to the magnetic field (sidewalls) and perfectly conducting walls perpendicular to the magnetic field (Hartmann walls). The velocity distribution exhibits strong jets at the sidewalls, which are susceptible to instability even at low Reynolds numbers Re. We explore the onset of time-dependent flow and transition to states with evolved turbulence for a moderate Hartmann number $Ha = 100$ . At low Re time-dependence appears in the form of elongated Ting-Walker vortices at the sidewalls of the duct, which, upon increasing Re, develop into more complex structures with higher energy and then the sidewall jets partially detach from the walls. At high values of Re jet detachments disappear and the flow consists of two turbulent jets and nearly laminar core. It is also demonstrated that, there is a range of Re, where Hunt's flow exhibits a pronounced hysteresis behavior, so that different unsteady states can be observed for the same flow parameters. In this range multiple states may develop and co-exist, depending on the initial conditions."},

First, we propose three alternative primal models for the BTP. We also define the concepts of negative sets, negative dual rectangles, and the optimal tableau for the BTP. Next, we explore the relationships between these concepts. We also propose two greedy heuristics, based on a linear programming relaxation of the BTP model, to find some negative sets and negative dual rectangles. These two heuristics turn out to be very efficient and obtain optimal or near-optimal BTP tableaus rapidly, as confirmed by the computational experiments. Then, an adapted Ford\u2013Fulkerson algorithm is presented and used to find an optimal solution. The two important advantages of our adapted Ford\u2013Fulkerson algorithm over the standard Ford\u2013Fulkerson algorithm are more flexibility and efficiency. Extensive computational results show that the growth in run-time of our hybrid algorithm, on average, is approximately a linear function of the BTP size. It has significant advantage over the transportation simplex method and on the largest problem instances it is almost five times faster. A key feature of the proposed algorithm is that it is free of degeneracy and cycling altogether."},

Here, we present data on the phenology and yield of winter rye in western Poland collected between 1957 and 2012 from a long-term field experiment. Data were examined for trends through time and compared to climatological factors using regression analysis. Both annual air temperature and precipitation increased during the study period, equivalent to 2 \u00b0C and 186 mm, respectively, over the 52-year period for which met data were available. We detected significant delays in sowing date and recently in emergence, but significant advances were apparent in full flowering date equivalent to 4 days/decade. Yield and plant density experienced a step like change in 1986; yield increasing by ca. 70 % and plant density increasing by ca. 50 %, almost coinciding with a similar change in annual mean temperature, but most likely caused by a changed seed rate and use of herbicides. Future climate change is expected to have a greater impact on this crop, but farmers may be able to adapt to these changes by modifying water regimes, using new machinery and sowing new rye varieties.\n\n"},

Our results suggest that selectivity is related to constraints that potential ligands encounter on their way from the surface of the protein to their final position at the pocket bottom. Tomographic docking helps develop specific hypotheses about ligand binding, distinguishing binders from non-binders, and suggests that binding is a three-step mechanism, consisting of engagement with a niche in the back wall of the pocket, interaction with a molecular filter which allows or precludes further descent of ligands, and binding on the pocket base. Only molecules that are able to descend the pocket and bind at its base allow the co-receptor IAA7 to bind on the complex, thus behaving as active auxins. Analyzing the interactions at different depths, our new method helps in identifying critical residues that constitute preferred future study targets and in the quest for safe and effective herbicides. Also, it has the potential to extend the utility of docking from ligand searches to the study of processes contributing to selectivity."},

This formalism can be based on sets, logic, partial orders, possibility theory, belief functions or imprecise probabilities. We propose a general notion of information item representing incomplete or uncertain information about the values of an entity of interest. It is supposed to rank such values in terms of relative plausibility, and explicitly point out impossible values. Basic issues affecting the results of the fusion process, such as relative information content and consistency of information items, as well as their mutual consistency, are discussed. For each representation setting, we present fusion rules that obey our principles, and compare them to postulates specific to the representation proposed in the past. In the crudest (Boolean) representation setting (using a set of possible values), we show that the understanding of the set in terms of most plausible values, or in terms of non-impossible ones matters for choosing a relevant fusion rule. Especially, in the latter case our principles justify the method of maximal consistent subsets, while the former is related to the fusion of logical bases. Then we consider several formal settings for incomplete or uncertain information items, where our postulates are instantiated: plausibility orderings, qualitative and quantitative possibility distributions, belief functions and convex sets of probabilities. The aim of this work is to provide a unified picture of fusion rules across various uncertainty representation settings.\n\n"},

How impact factors, such as different load patterns, EVs\u2019 charging locations and network topology, affect charging station location is becoming vital. In this paper a new charging station location methodology informed by impact factor analysis is proposed by using the Active and Reactive Power Dispatch of charging stations in terms of power loss minimization. Results for the 36 DN with three different scenarios are presented. In addition, a more realistic model based on EV's daily travel patterns is built to illustrate how these impact factors affect charging station location.

Not surprisingly, cells encode diverse regulatory mechanisms to buffer noise. One such mechanism is the incoherent feedforward circuit. We analyze a simplistic version of this circuit, where an upstream regulator X affects both the production and degradation of a protein Y. Thus, any random increase in X's copy numbers would increase both production and degradation, keeping Y levels unchanged. To study its stochastic dynamics, we formulate this network into a mathematical model using the Chemical Master Equation formulation. We prove that if the functional dependence of Y's production and degradation on X is similar, then the steady-distribution of Y's copy numbers is independent of X. To investigate how fluctuations in Y propagate downstream, a protein Z whose production rate only depend on Y is introduced. Intriguingly, results show that the extent of noise in Z increases with noise in X, in spite of the fact that the magnitude of noise in Y is invariant of X. Such counter intuitive results arise because X enhances the time-scale of fluctuations in Y, which amplifies fluctuations in downstream processes. In summary, while feedforward systems can buffer a protein from noise in its upstream regulators, noise can propagate downstream due to changes in the time-scale of fluctuations."},

We theoretically predict this gravity-driven effect for developed isotropic turbulence, with the ratio of Stokes to Froude number or equivalently the particle drift velocity governing the enhancement of acceleration variance and the reductions in correlation time and intermittency. Our predictions are in good agreement with experimental and numerical results. The present findings are relevant to a range of scenarios encompassing tiny bubbles and droplets that drift through the turbulent oceans and the atmosphere.

Android has become the main target to exploit due to having the largest install base amongst the smartphone operating systems and owing to the open access nature in which application installations are permitted. Many Android users are unaware of the risks associated with a malware infection and to what level current malware scanners protect them. This paper tests how efficient the currently available malware scanners are. To achieve this, ten representative Android security products were selected and tested against a set of 5,560 known and categorized Android malware samples. The tests were carried out using a digital-forensically rigorous testing framework and methodology, which ensures the scientific validity of the results. The detection rates of the tested malware scanners varied widely with half unable to detect any samples at all during initial testing. The malware scanners that were able to detect the samples scored highly with the top four between 97-99% and a fifth scanner scoring 87%. The results emphasise the need for more complex detection mechanisms and protections in future versions of Android and the next generation of malware scanners"},

The model was recently introduced to explain discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations of phase transitions in some systems where the Z q -symmetry is spontaneously broken. We analyse the marginal dimensions of the model, i.e., the value of r at which the order of the phase transition changes. In the q = 2 case, we determine that value to be ${r}_{{\\rm{c}}}=3.65(5);$ there is a second-order phase transition there when $r\\lt {r}_{{\\rm{c}}}$ and a first-order one at $r\\gt {r}_{{\\rm{c}}}$. We also analyse the region $1\\leqslant q\\lt 2$ and show that the change from second to first order there is manifest through a new mechanism involving two marginal values of r. The q = 1 limit gives bond percolation. Above the lower value r c1, the order parameters exhibit discontinuities at temperature $\\tilde{t}$ below a critical value t c. The larger value r c2 marks the point at which the phase transition at t c changes from second to first order. Thus, for ${r}_{{\\rm{c}}1}\\lt r\\lt {r}_{{\\rm{c}}2}$, the transition at t c remains second order while at $\\tilde{t}$ the system undergoes a first order phase transition. As r increases further, $\\tilde{t}$ increases, bringing the discontinuity closer to t c. Finally, when r exceeds r c2 $\\tilde{t}$ coincides with t c and the phase transition becomes first order. This new mechanism indicates how the discontinuity characteristic of first order phase transitions emerges."},

This technique makes it possible to visualise for the first time the coupling between the principal forces in a convection-driven dynamo by means of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) in a geometry relevant to planets. We first present the technology that enables us to generate these forces and implement PIV in a high magnetic field environment. We then show that the magnetic field drastically changes the structure of convective plumes in a configuration relevant to the tangent cylinder region of the Earth\u2019s core."},

To date, these aspects have received only modest attention. In the current study, we examine honeybee and beekeeping activity in southern Poland for the period 1965\u20132010, supplemented by hive yields from a beekeeper in southern UK in the same period. We show that despite negative reports on honeybee condition, and documented climate change, the studied apiary managed to show a marked increase in honey production over the 46 year study period, as did that from the UK. The proportion of the annual yield originating from the first harvest decreased during the study period and was associated with rising temperatures in summer. Honeybee spring phenology showed strong negative relationships with temperature but no overall change through time because temperatures of key early spring months had not increased significantly. In contrast, increasing yields and an increased number of harvests (and hence a later final harvest and longer season) were detected and were related to rising temperatures in late spring and in summer.\n\n"},

We derive an asymptotic solution for the base flow that is valid for not only high but also moderate magnetic fields. This solution shows that, for low wall conductance ratios c\u226a1, an extremely strong magnetic field with Hartmann number Ha\u223cc\u22124 is required to attain the asymptotic flow regime considered in previous studies. We use a vector streamfunction\u2013vorticity formulation and a Chebyshev collocation method to solve the eigenvalue problem for three-dimensional small-amplitude perturbations in ducts with realistic wall conductance ratios c=1, 0.1 and 0.01 and Hartmann numbers up to 104. As for similar flows, instability in a sufficiently strong magnetic field is found to occur in the sidewall jets with characteristic thickness \u03b4\u223cHa\u22121/2. This results in the critical Reynolds number and wavenumber increasing asymptotically with the magnetic field as Rec\u223c110Ha1/2 and kc\u223c0.5Ha1/2. The respective critical Reynolds number based on the total volume flux in a square duct with c\u226a1 is Re\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00afc\u2248520.

The flow takes place in a transverse, horizontal magnetic field. The results show that up to four different local minima may be present in the neural stability curve. Up to two of these modes may be the most unstable depending, critically, on the value of the Hartmann number. Over a wide range of moderate to high Hartmann numbers thermal waves dominate the instability. As the Hartmann number increases, however, this mode is strongly damped. Then the so-called Hartmann mode takes over, which involves the characteristic Hartmann layers at the walls appearing due to modification of the basic velocity profile by the magnetic field. Overall, for liquid metals at high magnetic fields the basic flow is very stable. Variation of the Prandtl number in a wide range has also been performed as, depending on the type of an electrically conducting fluid (liquid metal or various kind of electrolytes), the Prandtl number varies over several orders of magnitude. As may be expected, the increase of the Prandtl number lowers the instability threshold for the thermal waves.\n\n"},

The main interest here is in the stability of the flow for a sufficiently strong magnetic field, for the Hartmann number Ha > 10, and increasing to high values, of the order of 103\u2013104. The Prandtl number, Pr, has been fixed at Pr = 0.015. It is shown that besides the Hartmann number the instability strongly depends on the type of the thermal boundary conditions at the horizontal walls. For thermally conducting walls the basic temperature profile exhibits zones of unstable thermal stratification, which leads to instabilities owing to the Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard mechanism. However, the transitions between various, most unstable modes as Ha increases are not trivial. For sufficiently high values of Ha, the most unstable mode consists of transverse oscillatory rolls located in the region of unstable stratification. For thermally insulating walls, the transitions are simpler, and for sufficiently high Ha, the most unstable mode consists of longitudinal, steady, three-dimensional mode which is concentrated in the Hartmann layers at the horizontal boundaries. This mode has a combined dynamic-thermal origin and is owed to a strong shear in the Hartmann layers. The electrical boundary conditions do not qualitatively affect the picture of transitions between modes for both thermally conducting and thermally insulating walls."},

The paper aims to identify and associate learning features, such as feedback, activities, outcomes and assessment with location-driven mechanics, such as location-based activities, entities, conditions and actions that constitute the overarching elements of a proprietary location-based games authoring tool. We anticipate that this will pave the way for developing a model taxonomy that may be utilised to support and optimise future end-user profiles for serious game creation, games design for informal learning paths in science museums, science centres and field trips, learning methodologies development and metadata creation. The classification draws on the findings of a tailored approach applied to design and develop an authoring environment, the MAGELLAN platform, for creating location-based games and mobile location-driven scenarios directly influenced by end-user requirements and evaluation of trainee's feedback. Ultimately, the classification is conceived as part of a broader framework that defines and enables the creation of location-driven games by associating them with learning elements, through visualised design for expert and non-expert users as potential game authors. In an iterative process, the MAGELLAN Authoring Tool and subsequent user training and piloting process is featured as a test-bed, where the proposed taxonomy will be applied and evaluated."},

We used a large citizen science survey, providing over 1000 records across England, to test two competing hypotheses proposed in earlier studies. We were able to demonstrate the validity of both hypotheses; tar spot symptoms were reduced where there were fewer fallen leaves as a source of inoculum, and elevated nitrogen dioxide concentrations reduced tar spot symptoms above a threshold concentration of about 20 \u03bcg m\u22123. Symptom severity was also lower at sites with higher temperature and lower rainfall.

We analysed 568,456 observations of ten spring flowering or leafing phenophases derived from 3657 stations in 22 European countries in order to detect possible nonlinear responses to temperature. Linear response rates averaged for all stations ranged between \u22127.7 (flowering of hazel) and \u22122.7 days \u00b0C\u22121 (leaf unfolding of beech and oak).

For only \u223c14 % of the station time series (where a comparison between linear and nonlinear model was possible), nonlinear models described the relationship significantly better than linear models. Although in most cases simple linear models might be still sufficient to predict future changes, this linear relationship between phenology and temperature might not be appropriate when incorporating phenological data of very cold (and possibly very warm) environments. For these cases, extrapolations on the basis of linear models would introduce uncertainty in expected ecosystem changes."},

We prove several exact relations for general graphs that allow us to derive unambiguously the finite-size scaling behavior of the density of bridges and non-bridges. For percolation, we are also able to characterize the point for which clusters become maximally fragile and show that it is connected to the concept of the bridge load. Combining our exact treatment with further results from conformal field theory, we uncover a surprising behavior of the (normalized) variance of the number of (non-)bridges, showing that it diverges in two dimensions below the value View the MathML source of the cluster coupling q.

However, in realistic e-commerce environments, the review-related data are imbalanced, and this leads to a problem in which minority class information tends to be ignored during the training phase of a classification model. To address this problem, we propose a topic sentence-based instance transfer method to process imbalanced Chinese product reviews by using an auxiliary dataset (source dataset). The proposed method incorporates a rule and supervised learning hybrid approach to identify a topic sentence of each product review and adds the feature set of the topic sentence to the feature space of sentiment classification. Next, to measure the transferability of instances in source dataset, a greedy algorithm based on information gain of top-N common features is used to select common features. Then, a common feature-based cosine similarity of instances between source dataset and target dataset is introduced to select the transferable instances. Furthermore, a synthetic minority over-sampling technique (Smote) based method is adopted to overcome feature space inconsistency between the source dataset and target dataset. Finally, we immigrate the instances selected in source dataset into target dataset to form a new dataset for the training of classification model. Two datasets collected from Jingdong and Dangdang are the target dataset and source dataset. The experimental results verify that, considering the ability of generalization, our proposed method helps a support vector machine (SVM) to outperform other classification methods, such as the J48, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Random Committee methods, when applied to datasets produced by resampling and Smote."},

An extensive investigation on air-PCM-TES systems has been undertaken through passive and active methods and the advantages and disadvantages for each, are detailed. The thermal performances of these systems have been investigated through experimental and numerical approaches and listed in this paper. Passive methods e.g. use of PCMs in the building envelope present difficulty of exchanging a high rate of heat and therefore unsuitable for extreme climate. Therefore, active methods are adopted for extreme climates to meet the demand. Overall, when the right method is applied, air-PCM-TES systems have shown to be effectively providing free cooling and heating of the buildings through auxiliary sources."},

In this paper, a process-mining-based method is proposed to support business process designers to monitor efficiency or capture the changes of a business process. Firstly, we define a scenario model to depict business elements and their relationships which are critical to business process design. Based on the proposed scenario model, process mining algorithms, including control flow mining, roles mining and data flow mining are carried out in a certain sequence synthetically to extract business scenarios from event logs recorded by SOA application systems. Finally, we implement a prototype using a logistic scenario to illustrate the feasibility of our method in SOA applications development."},

Such problems sometimes elude the usual solving methods we are familiar with, forcing us to continuously improve these methods or to even completely reconsider the solving methodologies. When decision makers need faster and better results to more difficult problems, the quality of a decision support system is crucial. To estimate the quality of a decision support system when approaching difficult problems is not easy, but is very important when designing and conducting vital industrial processes or logistic operations. This paper studies the resilience of a solving method, initially designed for the static and deterministic TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) variant, when applied to an uncertain and dynamic TSP version. This investigation shows how a supplementary level of complexity can be successfully handled. The traditional ant-based system under investigation is infused with a technique which allows the evaluation of its performances when uncertain input data are present. Like the real ant colonies do, the system rapidly adapts to repeated environmental changes. A comparison with the performance of another heuristic optimization method is also done."},

Our method implements a mixed Adams-Bashforth/Crank-Nicolson scheme for the nonlinear terms in the MHD equations and we prove that it is stable independent of the time step. To ensure that the solenoidal condition is met for the magnetic field, we use a method whereby a pseudo-pressure is introduced into the induction equation; since we are concerned with incompressible flows, the resulting Poisson equation for the pseudo-pressure is solved alongside the equivalent Poisson problem for the velocity field. We validate our code in a variety of geometries including periodic boxes, spheres, spherical shells, spheroids and ellipsoids; for the finite geometries we implement the so-called ferromagnetic or pseudo-vacuum boundary conditions appropriate for a surrounding medium with infinite magnetic permeability. This implies that the magnetic field must be purely perpendicular to the boundary. We present a number of comparisons against previous results and against analytical solutions, which verify the code's accuracy. This documents the code's reliability as a prelude to its use in more difficult problems. We finally present a new simple drifting solution for thermal convection in a spherical shell that successfully sustains a magnetic field of simple geometry. By dint of its rapid stabilization from the given initial conditions, we deem it suitable as a benchmark against which other self-consistent dynamo codes can be tested."},

The unique attributes of cyberspace can be harnessed for power projection, the aim of which is ultimately to alter the behaviour of individuals. Although cyberspace has yet to be used as a medium to demonstrate conventional hard power of coercion and threats supported by physical force, it does present a suitable medium for the projection of soft power of attraction and imitation.

Through exploring the perceptions of coaches and players towards PA, its impact can be evaluated and areas for improvement highlighted (Bampouras et al., 2012; Wright et al., 2016). Previous research has explored coach and player perceptions of a range of PA provision from evaluation of ten 30-40 minutes feedback sessions (Groom & Cushion, 2005) to evaluation of PA support over a four year period (Bampouras et al., 2012). No study, however, has explored coach and player perception of PA provision within a Paralympic sport over any duration of service provision, let alone throughout a 4-year Paralympic cycle. The aim of this study, therefore, was to explore coach and player perceptions of the PA process within an elite men\u2019s international wheelchair basketball programme over the four-year period leading up to and including the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with three members of coaching staff and four players from a men\u2019s international wheelchair basketball team. In the interview they were asked to reflect on the integration of a PA process during the four-year period and how the analyst supported the process. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and returned to participants for member-checking. Once participants confirmed the content, the transcripts were subjected to inductive thematic analysis and a triangulation process. Results Two overarching themes emerged from the narrative: (1) barriers to the use of PA to inform practice and (2) the establishment of the coach-analyst and player-analyst relationship. The first theme included aspects of availability, time, knowledge of the discipline, ability to utilise technology and conflict with a coach\u2019s philosophy. The second theme resulted from emerging narratives surrounding communication, reputation and collective experiences. Discussion and Conclusion The person-implementation framework (Rizzuto & Reeves, 2007) was utilised to help explain the main barriers associated with using PA into problem sources, failure symptoms and leverage points. Sztompka's (1999) primary and secondary trustworthiness theory was then used to interpret how the development of a strong relationship between coaches, athletes and analysts could help remove any barriers. Coaches and players also believed future exposure and education to the possibilities of PA support was required. Through enhancing individuals\u2019 knowledge and developing strong relationships, coaches and players could engage more actively within the PA process to inform practice."},

The proposed method can detect dynamic and changing data, and then feedback to the prediction model to revise for better subsequent predictions. Furthermore, this method computes a global prediction result by aggregating local predictions in the resource bounded environment. Therefore, the prediction accuracy increases, and the computation time decreases. In the simulation, the Map-Reduce technology is used for parallel processing. The simulation results show that the prediction accuracy is raised by 14%, and the execution time is improved by almost 45%.\n\n"},

However, the standard reasoning and impact accumulation mechanisms developed for RBFCMs assume that the level of variation that a fuzzy set represents is directly linked with the shape of the fuzzy set. It poses a big restriction on how the corresponding fuzzy sets have to be constructed. In this paper we propose a new reasoning and impact accumulation mechanisms which take into consideration standard semantics of fuzzy sets, where their uncertainty is measured by fuzziness. New type of complex fuzzy relationships and reasoning on them is introduced to model a joint impact of several causal nodes on one effect node. With these new mechanisms, RBFCMs become much more flexible, provide more means to capture complexity of real world systems and are less computational demanding than standard mechanisms. The advantages of the new RBFCMs are demonstrated using different examples and compared with standard mechanisms."},

Previous studies have focused specifically on the technical aspects of free-throw shooting (Goosey-Tolfrey, Butterworth, & Morriss, 2002; Malone, Gervais, & Steadward, 2002) with limited research exploring the technical and tactical components of field-goal shooting (Francis, Owen, Molnar, & Peters, 2016). Francis et al.\u2019s (2016) work explored the technical and tactical factors affecting two-point and three-point shooting in the 2015 men\u2019s European Wheelchair Basketball Championships, identifying shot movement and shot positioning as being significantly related to shot outcome (successful versus unsuccessful; p < 0.001). This study explores the key determinants of two-point and three-point shooting across two major tournaments and develops a valid prediction model. Following ethical approval, footage of each two-point and three-point shot taken by the top five teams (30 games; 2432 shots) at the 2016 Paralympic Games was analysed in SportsCode (version 10, SportsTec Ltd) using the same performance analysis template and combined with the shooting data from the 2015 European Wheelchair Basketball Championships (nine games; 1144 shots; Francis et al, 2016) to provide data for 3576 shots. Chi-square tests highlighted eleven categorical variables that were significantly associated with shot outcome (p<0.001). The most significant categorical variable was the \u2018zone\u2019 in which the shot was taken. A binary logistic regression model was developed to assess the impact of these categorical variables as predictors of the probability of shooting success, using the forward selection method with 70% of the sample (2,499 shots). The final model included thirteen statistically significant predictors and when tested against the remaining 30% of the data an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.667 was achieved. The model demonstrated that the odds of a shot with similar characteristics being successful were approximately 1.2 times higher in the Paralympics compared to the European Championships (p < 0.05; Odds Ratio: 1.23) as teams at the Paralympics used different defensive systems to apply pressure. These findings support the previous model (Francis et al. 2016) and re-emphasize the importance of shot movement and shot positioning (p < 0.001) as key predictors of shot success. In addition, the new model highlights the odds of achieving a successful shot are increased when the shot is either taken early or late in the shot clock (Odds Ratios of seconds remaining in the shot clock: 0-6 seconds: 2.06; 7-12 seconds: 1.25; 13-17 seconds: 1.45; 18-24 seconds: 1.84). The information gained from this model could be used by coaches and support staff to provide technical and tactical feedback to enhance performance. During training sessions coaches can attempt to ensure players are taking shots in a square to basket position (Odds Ratio: 2.06) or can use the information to recreate shooting situations in order to work on areas of weakness to increase the players odds of success over time."},

In parallel for comparison, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were also used for classification in association with an Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) feature selection technique. The results obtained from this study are encouraging as low False Accept Rates (FAR) and False Reject Rates (FRR) were achieved in the experimentation phase. This signifies that satisfactory overall system performance was achieved by using the typing attributes in the proposed approach. Thus, the use of non-conventional typing features improves the understanding of human typing behavior and therefore, provides significant contribution to the authentication system."},

To obtain maximum irradiation under outdoor conditions, the module was inclined at an angle of 25o facing the southern direction (UK). To investigate the I-V characteristic of the PV module a single diode electrical equivalent model has been developed using MATLAB-Simulink and the measured results are discussed together with the simulation results. The measured results have shown that the module is capable of generating 17.75 W/m2 with an efficiency of 7% and 138 W/m2 with an efficiency of 8% from indoor office building and outdoor conditions respectively in UK during summer time. This research work makes a significant contribution to photovoltaic researchers to identify the suitable applications such as embedded devices or body-worn sensor for use both in indoor and outdoor conditions."},

This fundamental study is motivated in part by the desire to enhance heat transfer in the blanket ducts of nuclear fusion reactors. In pure magnetohydrodynamic flows, the imposed transverse magnetic field causes the flow to become quasi-two-dimensional and exhibit disturbances that are localized to the horizontal walls. However, the vertical temperature stratification in Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard flows feature convection cells that occupy the interior region, and therefore the addition of this aspect provides an interesting point for investigation. The linearized governing equations are described by the quasi-two-dimensional model proposed by Sommeria and Moreau [J. Fluid Mech. 118, 507 (1982)], which incorporates a Hartmann friction term, and the base flows are considered fully developed and one-dimensional. The neutral stability curves for critical Reynolds and Rayleigh numbers, Re c and Ra c, respectively, as functions of Hartmann friction parameter H have been obtained over 10\u22122 \u2264 H \u2264 104. Asymptotic trends are observed as H \u2192 \u221e following Re c \u221d H 1/2  and Ra c \u221d H. The linear stability analysis reveals multiple instabilities which alter the flow both within the Shercliff boundary layers and the interior flow, with structures consistent with features from plane Poiseuille and Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard flows."},

This range of   and   captures both steady-state two-dimensional flow solutions and the inception of unsteady two-dimensional flow.

The critical Reynolds number and the spanwise wavelength of perturbations increase as   increases.

Finally, for   , the critical Reynolds number and spanwise wavelength remain almost constant.

Whilst previous attempts to explore the key determinants of success within wheelchair basketball have identified that stronger teams accumulate a greater number of assists, turnovers, free-throw and field goal shooting attempts (G\u00f3mez et al. 2015; Molik et al. 2009), the use of secondary box score data in such studies has been questioned for both its validity and reliability (Ziv et al. 2010). The purpose of this study, therefore, was to explore the key determinants of team success within elite men\u2019s wheelchair basketball using a valid and reliable wheelchair basketball data collection system using primary data collected from match notation (see Francis et al., 2015). Following University ethical approval, footage from 31 men\u2019s games at the 2015 European Wheelchair Basketball Championships was coded using a developed template in SportsCode (V10, SportsTec Inc.) that included 108 action variables grouped into 19 categorical variables: Time, Home Team, Away Team, Offensive Unit (3.0/3.5), Offensive Unit (4.0/4.5), Defensive Unit (3.0/3.5), Defensive Unit (4.0/4.5), Match Status, Start of Possession, Man Out Offence, Shot Taken, Shot Point, Shot Outcome, Shot Location, Shot Clock Remaining, End of Possession, Defensive System, Defensive Outcome and Possession. The template\u2019s reliability had been assessed by Francis et al. (2015) (inter-observer reliability: 0-5% error; intra-observer reliability 0-5% error). The data was subjected to a two-stage statistical analysis procedure in R (R Core Team 2015). Stage 1: Chi-squared tests highlighted 15 categorical variables that were significantly (p<0.05) associated with final game outcome (winning versus losing). The category with the highest level of statistical significance was Match Status (p<0.001). Stage 2: The multicollinearity between explanatory categories were explored. Categories that demonstrated perfect collinearity were removed. Using a 70% sample of the data (4,288 possessions), a forward and backwards stepwise elimination approach was used to build a final model, which included seven categories comprising of 37 action variables: Match Status, Defensive Unit (3.0/3.5), Offensive Unit (3.0/3.5), Offensive Unit (4.0/4.5), Stage, Defensive System and Start of Possession. When tested against the remaining 30% data set an area under the curve value of 0.749 was achieved which suggests the model has \u2018fair\u2019 predictive qualities. The final model indicates the importance of maintaining a winning state throughout the game, selecting a unit which predominately comprises of three point players and countering when the defence are pressing. Coaches, players and support staff can utilise the findings from the study to assist with the planning of offensive and defensive game strategies by identifying areas for development within training sessions, supporting selection and line-up combinations and informing the decision-making process of coaches and players during performances."},

In the heteroscedastic case, LDA is not guaranteed to minimise this error. Assuming heteroscedasticity, we derive a linear classifier, the Gaussian Linear Discriminant (GLD), that directly minimises the Bayes error for binary classification. In addition, we also propose a local neighbourhood search (LNS) algorithm to obtain a more robust classifier if the data is known to have a non-normal distribution. We evaluate the proposed classifiers on two artificial and ten real-world datasets that cut across a wide range of application areas including handwriting recognition, medical diagnosis and remote sensing, and then compare our algorithm against existing LDA approaches and other linear classifiers. The GLD is shown to outperform the original LDA procedure in terms of the classification accuracy under heteroscedasticity. While it compares favourably with other existing heteroscedastic LDA approaches, the GLD requires as much as 60 times lower training time on some datasets. Our comparison with the support vector machine (SVM) also shows that, the GLD, together with the LNS, requires as much as 150 times lower training time to achieve an equivalent classification accuracy on some of the datasets. Thus, our algorithms can provide a cheap and reliable option for classification in a lot of expert systems. "},

Unlike past magnetohydrodynamic setups involving a shallow confinement, the experiment presented here drives turbulence whose dimensionality can be set anywhere between three-dimensional and quasi two-dimensional. In particular, we show that the dimensionality and componentality of the turbulence thus generated are in fact completely fixed by the single parameter  lz(li)/hlz(li)/h , which quantifies the competition between the solenoidal component of the Lorentz force and inertia acting on a turbulent structure of the size of the forcing scale  lili . This parameter is fully tunable thanks to the three operating settings at hand: the injection scale, the intensity of the electric forcing and the magnitude of the magnetic field. Thanks to the very high number of measuring probes and fast acquisition rate implemented in this experiment, it is possible to reliably measure the finest features of the inertial range on a scale-wise basis."},

Cloud computing has created a new concept to deal with software services and hardware infrastructure. Some benefits are immediate; for instance, to allow students to share their information easily and to discover new experiences of the education system. However, despite the comprehensive literature, there is still limited studies related to the applied factors that influence the adoption of cloud technology at higher education institutions. Such limitations in the literature arise clearly in developing countries. This paper attempts to enhance the understanding of related factors affecting the adoption of cloud computing in the educational context of developing nations. A fieldwork study for collecting data has been conducted at higher education institutions in the kingdom of Jordan. This study applied an interpretive paradigm with a qualitative research method to investigate the main enablers of and barriers to cloud computing adoption at the universities in developing countries in general and in the case of Jordan in particular."},

This paper reports on a CLIL project on environmental pollution and the science of climate change with a community/heritage language, namely Greek, as the vehicular language. The project was implemented in the Greek supplementary school of Leicester, UK, and aimed at teaching students aged 11 to 17 scientific concepts (including those relating to the greenhouse effect, carbon cycle, climate change) while at the same time advancing language acquisition. It included various in-class activities and a visit to the Science Museum in London. Data collection included questionnaires, interviews, materials used in the activities and field notes to investigate the perceived impact of the project on heritage language learners. The ultimate aim of the research was to examine whether CLIL had a role to play in heritage language education, a field with distinct challenges. Gains were reported across language and content learning, cognition and attitudes. Perhaps the most significant finding was that the approach facilitated the building of linguistic and cognitive bridges between the students' linguistic heritage and their mainstream education. The article links classroom practice to research and argues for the inclusion of CLIL in supplementary schools, as an effective pedagogy for the teaching and learning of heritage languages."},

Despite the fact that many practical and theoretical algorithms have successfully attempted to provide Pareto optimal solutions, they have focused on attempting to reach Pareto Optimality using horizontal approaches, where optimality is calculated taking into account every participant at the same time. Sometimes, this may prove to be a difficult task (e.g., conflict, mistrust, no information sharing, etc.). In this paper, we explore the possibility of achieving Pareto Optimal outcomes in a group by using a bottom-up approach: discovering Pareto optimal outcomes by interacting in subgroups. We analytically show that the set of Pareto optimal outcomes in a group covers the Pareto optimal outcomes within its subgroups. This theoretical finding can be applied in a variety of scenarios such as negotiation teams, multi-party negotiation, and team formation to social recommendation. Additionally, we empirically test the validity and practicality of this proof in a variety of decision making domains and analyze the usability of this proof in practical situations."},

Short and long term storage helps in the reduction of energy demand or shifting peak load for both heating and cooling. However, a comprehensive study for the application of these technologies adopting Chinese built environment is lacking which can relate to climate, energy storage and energy efficiency. The goal of this paper is to provide coherent picture of current status on PCM-based techniques that have been studied with the focus of application in China and analyse the selection and suitability of PCMs and techniques in Chinese regions.

In this article, we propose a scheduler which initially detects the highest throughput each device can obtain for a specific application with negligible overhead and then partitions the dataset for improved performance. To demonstrate the efficiency of this method, we choose a Zynq UltraScale+ ZCU102 device as the hardware target and parallelise four applications showing that the developed scheduler can provide up to 94.06% of the throughput achievable at an ideal condition, with comparable power and energy consumption."},

In a wideband frequency co-operative spectrum sensing, different CR nodes can be assigned to different frequency bands to detect the spectrum hole. Spectrum hole is a 3-dimensional concept, where space, time and frequency are involved. By estimating the probable distance, time and frequency of primary user and applying transmit power control to the CR node, we can maximize the spectrum efficiency. Since in D2D (Device to Device) communication, the distance of communication is shorter and the propagation delays can be estimated, we can perform very accurate transmit power control. Using a 3-dimensional spectrum detector to detect spectrum holes in space, time and frequency will yield higher spectrum efficiency because it enhances the degrees of freedom from 1 to 3 and, hence, provides flexibility to use resources with lowest probability of interference."},

While the leading scaling behavior in the disordered system is therefore identical between the second-order and first-order segments of the phase diagram of the pure model, the finite-size scaling in the ex-first-order regime is affected by strong transient effects with a crossover length scale $L^{\\ast} \\approx 32$ for the chosen parameters."},

It regulates a wide range of processes throughout the plant. Synthetic auxins exploit the auxin-signalling pathway and are valuable as herbicidal agrochemicals. Currently, despite a diversity of chemical scaffolds all synthetic auxins have a carboxylic acid as the active core group. By applying bio-isosteric replacement we discovered that indole-3-tetrazole was active by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectrometry, showing that the tetrazole could initiate assembly of the TIR1 auxin co-receptor complex. We then tested the tetrazole's efficacy in a range of whole plant physiological assays and in protoplast reporter assays which all confirmed auxin activity, albeit rather weak. We then tested indole-3-tetrazole against the AFB5 homologue of TIR1, finding that binding was selective against TIR1, absent with AFB5. The kinetics of binding to TIR1 are contrasted to those for the herbicide picloram, which shows the opposite receptor preference as it binds to AFB5 with far greater affinity than to TIR1. The basis of the preference of indole-3-tetrazole for TIR1 was revealed to be a single residue substitution using molecular docking, and assays using tir1 and afb5 mutant lines confirmed selectivity in vivo. Given the potential that a TIR1-selective auxin might have for unmasking receptor-specific actions, we followed a rational design, lead optimisation campaign and a set of chlorinated indole-3-tetrazoles was synthesised. Improved affinity for TIR1 and the preference for binding to TIR1 was maintained for 4-and 6-chloroindole-3-tetrazoles, coupled with improved efficacy in vivo. This work expands the range of auxin chemistry for the design of receptor-selective synthetic auxins."},

In particular, modelling and simulating 3C- and 4H- Silicon Carbide (SiC), Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Diamond devices are examined. The challenges associated with modelling the material and device physics are analysed in detail. It also includes convergence issues and accuracy of predicted performance. Modelling and simulating defects, traps and the effect of these traps on the characteristics are also discussed. "},

If a Bayes classifier is to be used, then reduction to a dimensionality of $K-1$ is necessary and sufficient to preserve the classification information in the original feature space for the $K$-class problem. However, most of the existing algorithms provide no optimal dimensionality to which to reduce the data, thus classification information can be lost in the reduced space if $K-1$ dimensions are used. In this paper, we present a novel LDR technique to reduce the dimensionality of the original data to $K-1$, such that it is well-primed for Bayesian classification. This is done by sequentially constructing linear classifiers that minimise the Bayes error via a gradient descent procedure, under an assumption of normality. We experimentally validate the proposed algorithm on $10$ UCI datasets. Our algorithm is shown to be superior in terms of the classification accuracy when compared to existing algorithms including LDR based on Fisher's criterion and the Chernoff criterion. The applicability of our algorithm is then demonstrated by employing it in diagnosing the health states of $2$ ultrasonic flow meters. As with the UCI datasets, the proposed algorithm is found to have superior performance to the existing algorithms, achieving classification accuracies of $99.4\\%$ and $97.5\\%$ on the two flow meters. Such high classification accuracies on the flow meters promise significant cost benefits in oil and gas operations."},

This problem has been addressed in this paper by suggesting a system that combines two methods, both of which provide a reduced training requirement for user authentication using free-text keystrokes.  The two methods were fused to achieve error rates lower than those produced by each method separately. Two fusion schemes, namely: decision-level fusion and feature-level fusion, were applied. Feature-level fusion was done by concatenating two sets of features before the learning stage. The two sets of features were: a timing feature set and a non-conventional feature set. Moreover, decision-level fusion was used to merge the output of two methods using majority voting. One is Support Vector Machines (SVMs) together with Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) feature selection and the other is decision trees (DTs). Even though the classifiers using the parameters merged at feature level produced low error rates, its results were outperformed by the results achieved by the decision-level fusion scheme. Decision-level fusion was employed to achieve the best performance of 0.00% False Accept Rate (FAR) and 0.00% False Reject Rate (FRR)."},

Network administrators do not have much power to control and mon- itor their networks. Therefore, a new network architecture, so-called software-defined net- working (SDN), has emerged to address these challenging issues by redefining the network to make it programmable. SDN relies on decoupling the control plane from the data plane so that it is central and programmable. OpenFlow protocol, which is an open source proto- col adopted by the Open Networking Foundation, is empowered to facilitate the communi- cation between controller and switch and to enable agile management of the network. However, OpenFlow-based SDN has two shortcomings that affect the network\u2019s perfor- mance. First, the communication between the controller and the switch introduces further delay in round-trip time (RTT). Second, the RTT delay results in packet loss or packets ar- riving at the destination out of order. These two major issues are more likely to occur with UDP traffic due to its characteristics. This paper explains the reasons behind these issues, hypothetically discusses some potential solutions and implements the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm reduces the number of packets out of order by increasing the hard timeout time of flow entries when the CPU\u2019s usage increases and by gathering statis- tics from the switch more often. During the demonstration of OpenFlow-based SDN, a POX controller and Mininet are used to emulate the infrastructure needed.\n\nPublisher Statement: NOTICE: this is the author\u2019s version of a work that was accepted for publication in Computers & Electrical Engineering.

Existing NMF-based methods for community discovery often factorize the corresponding adjacent matrix of complex networks to obtain its community indicator matrix. However, the adjacent matrix cannot represent the global structure feature of complex networks very well, and this leads to the performance degradation of community discovery. Besides, most of existing methods are not robust and scalable enough, so they are not effective to deal with complex networks with noises and large-scales. Aiming at these problems above, in this paper we propose a method for community discovery using distributed robust NMF with SimRank similarity measure. This method selects SimRank measure to construct the feature matrix, which can more accurately represent the global structure feature of complex networks. To improve the robustness, we select \u21132;1 norm instead of the widely used Frobenius norm to construct its NMFbased community discovery model. In addition, to improve the scalability, we implement its key components by using MapReduce distributed computing framework, including computing SimRank feature matrix and iteratively solving the NMF-based model for community discovery. We conduct extensive experiments on several typical complex networks. The results show that our method has better performance and robustness than other representative NMF-based methods for community discovery. Moreover, our method presents good scalability, and hence can be used to discover communities in the largescale complex networks."},

However, the end-goal of retention differs between entertainment and serious contexts. For an entertainment game, engagement and retention is linked to monetization; for a serious game, this needs to persist for as long as is required for learning or behavioural objectives to be met. User engagement is strongest when a balance is achieved between difficulty and skill, leading to a state of \u201cflow\u201d. Hence adapting difficulty could lead to increased and sustained engagement. Implementing this requires the identification of variables linked to mechanics, manipulated based upon a player performance model. In some cases, this is possible by adjusting simple properties of objects, though more comprehensive solutions require extending or adapting content applying procedural techniques. This paper proposes a six step plan, validated against two case studies: an existing serious game, with easily-manipulated parameters, and a platformer game built from scratch, where additional content is required, showing the process for different mechanics. To explore limitations, the results of two small-scale user evaluations with 45 users in total, are reported, contributing to the understanding of how adaptive difficulty might be implemented and received."},

These relationships have begun to be explored through the concept of inequalities in child welfare, in parallel to the established fields of inequalities in education and health. This article focuses on the relationship between economic inequality and out-of-home care and child protection interventions. The work scales up a pilot study in the West Midlands to an all-England sample, representative of English regions and different levels of deprivation at a local authority (LA) level. The analysis evidences a strong relationship between deprivation and intervention rates and large inequalities between ethnic categories. There is further evidence of the inverse intervention law (Bywaters et al., 2015): for any given level of neighbourhood deprivation, higher rates of child welfare interventions are found in LAs which are less deprived overall. These patterns are taking place in the context of cuts in spending on English children\u2019s services between 2010-11 and 2014-15 that have been greatest in more deprived LAs. Implications for policy and practice to reduce such inequalities are suggested."},

This paper recognises human activities using a sensor that retains privacy. The sensor is not only different by being thermal, but it is also of low resolution: 8x8 pixels. The combination of the thermal imaging, and the low spatial resolution ensures the privacy of individuals. We present an approach to recognise daily activities using this sensor based on a discrete cosine transform. We evaluate the proposed method on a state-of-the-art dataset and experimentally confirm that our approach outperforms the baseline method. We also introduce a new dataset, and evaluate the method on it. Here we show that the sensor is considered better at detecting the occurrence of falls and Activities of Daily Living. Our method achieves an overall accuracy of 87.50% across 7 activities with a fall detection sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.21%."},

These structures are less than 70 \u03bcm in total thickness and are directly placed in contact with the polished sapphire substrate of 450-nm-emitting LEDs.

In this paper, a novel approach is presented aiming to reliably detect this type of fault condition. The proposed method is based on the analysis of specific subcomponents of the stray flux over time. The analysis is implemented on an industrial 1.1 MW industrial induction motor, since large industrial motors make the cases where MCSA might fail due to the weak speed ripple effect and closeness of the fault's sidebands to the fundamental harmonic.

Sometimes with little relevant expertise and often in time-critical scenarios, assessing threat, risk and proportionate response based on a mix of official briefings, academic sources, and industry threat reports is a challenge. The imperative of dealing with such issues in a timely fashion presents novel technical and political challenges for policy advisers.

In recent work on models of gene expression, it was shown that a mapping based on partitioning of Poisson arrivals (PPA-mapping) can lead to exact solutions for previously unsolved problems. While the approach can be used in general when the model involves Poisson processes corresponding to creation or degradation, current applications of the method and new results derived using it have been limited to date. In this paper, we present the exact solution of a variation of the two-stage model of gene expression (with time dependent transition rates) describing the arbitrary partitioning of proteins. The methodology proposed makes full use of the PPA-mapping by transforming the original problem into a new process describing the evolution of three biological switches. Based on a succession of transformations, the method leads to a hierarchy of reduced models. We give an integral expression of the time dependent generating function as well as explicit results for the mean, variance, and correlation function. Finally, we discuss how results for time dependent parameters can be extended to the three-stage model and used to make inferences about models with parameter fluctuations induced by hidden stochastic variables."},

This is due to its higher reliability and lower maintenance reported in the literature. It is shown in this paper from the study of the magnetic field distribution in the rotor core that the conventional design of the BDFM rotor iron core can be modified, leading to a lighter machine. The proposed design method is supported by an analytical study and its practicality is validated using 2-D Finite Element (FE) analysis. A 250 kW experimental BDFM with frame size D400 is considered as the prototype machine."},

The main contributions of the paper are as follows. Firstly, two hypotheses on e-learners\u2019 different learning path preferences for four different learning scenarios (initial learning, usual review, pre-exam learning and pre-exam review) are verified through questionnaire-based statistical analysis. Secondly, according to learning behavior characteristics of four types of the learning scenarios, a multi-constraint learning path recommendation model is proposed, in which the variables and their weighted coefficients considers different learning path preferences of the learners in different learning scenarios as well as learning resource organization and fragmented time. Thirdly, based on the proposed model and knowledge map, the design and implementation of a multi-constraint learning path recommendation algorithm is described. Finally, it is shown that the questionnaire results from over 110 e-learners verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show the similarity between the learners\u2019 self-organized learning paths and the recommended learning paths."},

But, the private information from IoT devices is stored in distributed private cloud server so that only legitimate users are allowed to access the sensitive information from the cloud server. Keeping focus on all these points, this article first shows security vulnerabilities of the multi-server cloud environment of the protocols proposed by Xue et al. and Chuang et al. Then, we propose an architecture which is applicable for distributed cloud environment and based on it, an authentication protocol using smartcard has been proposed, where the registered user can access all private information securely from all the private cloud servers. To proof security strength of our protocol, we have used AVISPA tool and BAN logic model in this article. In addition, informal cryptanalysis confirms that the protocol is protected against all possible security threats. The performance analysis and comparison confirm that the proposed protocol is superior than its counterparts."},

In this paper, an accurate equation for the impact of dead time on the sensitivity of a SPAD array is presented. In addition, the impact of the width of the output pulses on the on-off keying data rate is investigated. Finally, a comparison between receivers containing an avalanche photo-diode (APD) and a large array of SPADs shows that although the receiver containing the SPAD is more sensitive in the dark, the APD-based receiver is more sensitive in a normal operating condition.

Even in clear atmospheric conditions, the FSO link experiences severe fading due to the turbulence effect. Turbulence is induced by random variations in refractive index due to temperature and pressure fluctuations along the FSO beam propagation. Turbulence can introduce deep fading (20 to 30 dB); as a result, the outage probability increases significantly. In order to mitigate the channel fading, the receiver or transmitter diversities or a combined transmitter and receiver diversity (known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques) are often considered along with other techniques such as modulation, temporal and wavelength diversities. In this chapter, the FSO link performance in the presence of the turbulence fading using transmitter and receiver diversity is discussed."},

Interestingly, the forward biased part of the Current-Voltage (I-V) characteristics in these devices carries considerable information about the material quality. In this context, an advanced Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) model for a vertical Platinum/3C-SiC Schottky power diode is created and validated with measured data. The model includes defects originating from both the Schottky contact and the hetero-interface of 3C-SiC with Si which allows the investigation of their impact on the magnification of the sub-threshold current. For this, barrier lowering, quantum field emission and trap assisted tunneling of majority carriers need to be considered at the non-ideal Schottky interface. The simulation results and measured data allowed for the comprehensive characterization of the defects affecting the carrier transport mechanisms of the forward biased 3C-SiC on Si power rectifier for the first time."},

In the first-level, a variable-threshold dynamic programming algorithm to distribute the power between the energy storage system and the engine is proposed. By adding supercapacitor to form the hybrid energy storage system, and using adaptive low-pass filtering algorithm, the power between the battery and the supercapacitor is distributed. To control the supercapacitor and battery to work within the capacity range, a power limits management module for redistributing the power between the engine, the supercapacitor and the battery is considered. The adaptive low-pass filtering algorithm and power limits management module constitute adaptive power allocation method in the second-level. After that, the rain-flow counting algorithm is applied in this paper to calculate battery aging cost. By using the rain-flow counting algorithm, the battery performances are analyzed, and the results show that the adaptive power allocation method can improve the battery service life by about 54.9% compared with the global dynamic programming algorithm. Considering the initial cost of the supercapacitor, the costs of battery aging, fuel consumption, electricity consumption, and management cost of retired batteries, compared with the global dynamic programming algorithm, the life cycle economy of the vehicle is improved by 12.4% under the proposed method."},

In this paper, we present a novel approach for plagiarism detection without reference collections. The proposed approach relies on using some statistical properties of the most common words, and the Latent Semantic Analysis that is applied to extract the most common words usage patterns. This method aims to generate a model of author\u2019s \u201cstyle\u201d by revealing a set of certain features of authorship. The model generation procedure focuses on just one author, as an attempt to summarise the aspects of an author\u2019s style in a definitive and clear-cut manner. The feature set of the intrinsic model were based on the frequency of the most common words, their relative frequencies in the book series, and the deviation of these frequencies across all books for a particular author. The approach has been evaluated using the leave-one-out-cross-validation method on the CEN (Corpus of English Novel) data set. Results have indicated that, by integrating deep latent semantic and stylometric analyses, hidden changes can be identified when a reference collection does not exist. The results have also shown that our Multi-Layer Perceptron based approach statistically outperforms Bayesian Network, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest models, by accurately predicting the author classes with an overall accuracy of 97%.

Due to its low cost as well as easy availability of data sharing and accessing devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) has grown exponentially during the past few years. The availability of these devices plays a remarkable role in the new era of mHealth. In mHealth, the sensors generate enormous amounts of data and the context-aware computing has proven to collect and manage the data. The context aware computing is a new domain to be aware of context of involved devices. The context-aware computing is playing a very significant part in the development of smart mobile health applications to monitor the health of patients more efficiently. Security is one of the key challenges in IoT-based mHealth application development. The wireless nature of IoT devices motivates attackers to attack on application; these vulnerable attacks can be denial of service attack, sinkhole attack, and select forwarding attack. These attacks lead intruders to disrupt the application's functionality, data packet drops to malicious end and changes the route of data and forwards the data packet to other location. There is a need to timely detect and prevent these threats in mobile health applications. Existing work includes many security frameworks to secure the mobile health applications but all have some drawbacks. This paper presents existing frameworks, the impact of threats on applications, on information, and different security levels. From this line of research, we propose a security framework with two algorithms, ie, (i) patient priority autonomous call and (ii) location distance based switch, for mobile health applications and make a comparative analysis of the proposed framework with the existing ones."},

Due to the virtues of better interpretability and \ufb02exibility, matrix factorization based methods for network embedding have received increasing attentions. However, most of them are inadequate to learn more complicated hierarchical features hidden in complex networks because of their mechanisms of single-layer factorization structure. Besides, their original feature matrices used for factorization and their robustness against noises also need to be further improved. To solve these problems, we propose a novel network embedding method named DRNMF (deep robust nonnegative matrix factorization), which is formed by multi-layer NMF learning structure. Meanwhile, DRNMF employs the combination of high-order proximity matrices of the network as the original feature matrix for the factorization. To improve the robustness against noises, we use l2,1 norm to devise the objective function for the DRNMF network embedding model. Effective iterative update rules are derived to resolve the model, and the convergence of these rules is strictly proved. Moreover, we introduce a pre-training strategy to improve the ef\ufb01ciency of convergence. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks of complex networks demonstrate that our proposed method DRNMF is effective and has better performance than the state-of-the-art matrix factorization based methods for network embedding."},

The anchoring mode enables the robot to stay in a specific place overcoming external disturbances (e.g. peristalsis) for a better and prolonged observation. The modelling of the legged, hybrid and anchoring modes are presented and analysed. Simulation results show robot propulsions in various modes. The hybrid capsule robot consisting four operating modes is more effective for the locomotion and observation within GI tract when compared to the locomotion consisting a single mean of locomotion as the hybrid robot can switch among the operating modes to suit the situation/task."},

In order to fully benefit from this distributed ledger technology, its limitations, cost, complexity and empowerment also have to be critically appraised. Depending on the specific context of the problem to be solved, these limitations have been handled to some extent through a clear dichotomy in the blockchain architectures, namely by conceiving both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. Permissionless blockchain requires massive computing power to achieve consensus, while its permissioned counterpart is energy efficient but would require trusted participants. To combine these benefits by gaining trust at a high energy efficiency, a novel mechanism is proposed for automatically learning the trust level of users in a public blockchain network and granting them access to a private blockchain network. In this context, machine learning is a very powerful tool capable of automatically learning the trust level. We have proposed reinforcement learning for bridging the dichotomy of blockchains in terms of striking a trust vs complexity trade-off in an unknown environment. Benefits and limitations of various forms of blockchain techniques are analyzed, followed by their reinforcement-aided evolution. We demonstrate that the proposed reinforcement learning aided blockchain is capable of supporting high-integrity autonomous operation and decision making in wireless networks. The win-win amalgamation of these techniques has been demonstrated for striking a compelling balance between the benefits of permissioned and permissionless blockchain networks through the case-study of the proposed blockchain based unmanned aerial vehicle aided wireless networks."},

On the basis of the characteristic function (CHF) of GG random variables, we derived an approximated bit-error rate (BER) for the CAP modulation scheme with spatial diversity and equal-gain combining (EGC). Furthermore, we simulated the performance of the CAP system with diversity and LDPC for various turbulence conditions and validated the analysis. Obtained results showed that the combination of LDPC and spatial diversity is effective in mitigating turbulence-induced fading, especially when turbulence strength is strong."},

This revolution comes with numerous advantages and viable opportunities that can transform the world of wireless communications for the better. Solid-state LEDs are rapidly replacing the contemporary incandescent and fluorescent lamps. In addition to their high energy efficiency, LEDs are desirable for their low heat generation, long lifespan, and their capability to switch on and off at an extremely high rate. The ability of switching between different levels of luminous intensity at such a rate has enabled the inception of a new communication technology referred to as visible light communication (VLC). With this technology, the LED lamps are additionally being used for data transmission. This paper provides a tutorial and a survey of VLC in terms of the design, development, and evaluation techniques as well as current challenges and their envisioned solutions. The focus of this paper is mainly directed towards an indoor setup. An overview of VLC, theory of illumination, system receivers, system architecture, and ongoing developments are provided. We further provide some baseline simulation results to give a technical background on the performance of VLC systems.

In this paper, a novel frequency-dependent plasticity mechanism (FDSP) for neurocomputing applications is presented. It is proposed that synaptic junctions could be used to perform bandpass filtering on the input stimulus. The unique transfer function of a bandpass filter replaces the conventional weight value associated with synaptic connections. The proposed model has been simulated and rigorously tested with standard machine learning benchmarks such as XOR and multivariate IRIS dataset while utilising minimum resources. The proposed model offers a unique advantage and has the potential to overcome the burden of hidden layer neurons from the network. Exclusion of hidden layer from the network significantly reduces the size of the network and hence the computational effort required for classification tasks. The proposed FDSP mechanism allows for complete analogue system design with a frequency multiplexed communication scheme. The main goal of this study is to establish frequency-dependent plasticity as an alternative to existing time-domain based techniques. The proposed method has a number of applications in neurocomputing, low power IoT devices and compute-efficient Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs)."},

The game embraces the notion of multimodal teaching and learning, as a way to present multiple representations of content such as text, images, video, audio and pervasive media, by augmenting modes with tools, teaching strategies and locations as means to create ideational, interpersonal and textual meanings. A questionnaire was employed to school teachers (n = 54) for understanding how multimodality was experienced through using the serious game as (1) stipulating diversity and increasing knowledge retention, (2) developing senses for attaining deeper understanding of the subject topic, (3) involving students into learning design and (4) supporting student\u2019s autonomy and self-direction. The findings revealed an explicit connection between theory and practice as experienced through the game\u2019s semiotic domain whilst contemplating on attempts to transcend experiences of in-game multimodality to lived classrooms."},

Monte Carlo simulation is used to examine the obtained statistical model for different transmission scenarios. In addition, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the statistical model and Monte Carlo simulation has been performed to verify that they represent the same distribution. The results show that the channel statistical distribution varies with the traffic flow and inter-vehicular spacing, which changes at different times of the day. The results also show that the path loss values of the non-line-of-sight component are significantly larger than the path loss values of the line-of-sight component of the channel when a single reflector is considered. However, at rush hours, when inter-vehicle spacing becomes shorter, the path loss value of multiple reflections decreases significantly."},

Simaula is a prototype game designed and used as a virtual practicum for eliciting understandings on how in-game inquiry was appeared to, or experienced by, the participating teachers. Group interviews with 20 secondary education science teachers revealed four qualitatively different ways of experiencing inquiry-based learning through Simaula: (a) as uncovering insights about student\u2019s learning needs, interests and emotions; (b) as generating ideas and concepts for meaningful inquiry; (c) as a set of operations for designing and carrying out scientific research; and (d) as authentic inquiry for enabling knowledge building processes. Seven dimensions of variation have been identified viewed as contextual influences on conceptions of in-game inquiry constituting discernment of: epistemic inquiry-based learning modes; role of teacher; role of student; game-play focus; core mechanics focus; feedback and progress mechanics and game uncertainty. The results illuminated a partial in-game inquiry approach with distinct epistemic modes from developing empathy and meaning making to knowledge construction and knowledge building. The findings also indicated that game design elements played central role in shaping conceptions of in-game inquiry from focusing on rules and logic as means to completing the game\u2019s level to understanding the complexity of core mechanics for developing and transferring in-game inquiry to the real classroom. This insinuates that distinct game design properties may be considered in terms of extending intrinsic in-game inquiry experiences to actual in-class inquiry practice."},

To assess their safe design and robust decision making in response to all possible scenarios, new methods that use a scenario-based testing approach are needed, as testing on public roads in normal traffic would require driving millions of kilometres. We make use of the scenario-based testing approach and propose a method to model simulated scenarios using Gaussian Process based models to predict untested scenario outcomes. This enables us to efficiently determine the performance boundary, where the safe and unsafe scenarios can be evidently distinguished from each other. We present an iterative method that optimises the parameter space of a logical scenario towards the most critical scenarios on this performance boundary. Additionally, we conduct a novel probabilistic sensitivity analysis by efficiently computing several variance-based sensitivity indices using the Gaussian Process models and evaluate the relative importance of the scenario input parameters on the scenario outcome. We critically evaluate and investigate the usefulness of the proposed Gaussian Process based approach as a very efficient surrogate model, which can model the logical scenarios effectively in the presence of uncertainty. The proposed approach is applied on an exemplary logical scenario and shows viability in finding concrete critical scenarios. The reported results, derived from the proposed approach, could pave the way to more efficient testing of automated vehicles and instruct further physical tests on the determined critical scenarios."},

Besides, construction activities produce the highest amount of waste among all other sectors. According to the waste hierarchies, reuse is preferred to recycling; however, most of the recovery of construction and demolition wastes happens in the form of recycling and not reuse. Part of the recent efforts to promote the reuse rates includes estimating the reusability of the load-bearing building components to assist the stakeholders in making sound judgements of the reuse potentials at the end-of-life of a building and alleviate the uncertainties and perceived risks. This study aims to develop a probabilistic model using advanced supervised machine learning techniques (including random forest, K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm, Gaussian process, and support vector machine) to predict the reuse potential of structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. For this purpose, using an online questionnaire, this paper seeks the experts\u2019 opinions with actual reuse experience in the building sector to assess the identified barriers by the authors in an earlier study. Furthermore, the results of the survey are used to develop an easy-to-understand learner for assessing the technical reusability of the structural elements at the end-of-life of a building. The results indicate that the most significant factors affecting the reuse of building structural components are design-related including, matching the design of the new building with the strength of the recovered element."},

Multiple risk factors for COVID-19 have been identified including various demographics, co-morbidities, biochemical parameters, and physical assessment findings. However, using this vast data to improve clinical care has proven challenging.\nAims to develop a reliable, multivariable predictive model for COVID-19 in-patient outcomes, to aid risk-stratification and earlier clinical decision-making.\nMethods Anonymized data regarding 44 independent predictor variables of 355 adults diagnosed with COVID-19, at a UK hospital, was manually extracted from electronic patient records for retrospective, case-controlled analysis. Primary outcomes included inpatient mortality, level of ventilatory support and oxygen therapy required, and duration of inpatient treatment. Secondary pulmonary embolism was the only secondary outcome. After balancing data, key variables were feature selected for each outcome using random forests. Predictive models were created using Bayesian Networks, and cross-validated.\n\nResults Our multivariable models were able to predict, using feature selected risk factors, the probability of inpatient mortality (F1 score 83.7%, PPV 82%, NPV 67.9%); level of ventilatory support required (F1 score varies from 55.8% \u201cHigh-flow Oxygen level\u201d to 71.5% \u201cITU-Admission level\u201d); duration of inpatient treatment (varies from 46.7% for \u201c\u2265 2 days but < 3 days\u201d to 69.8% \u201c\u2264 1 day\u201d); and risk of pulmonary embolism sequelae (F1 score 85.8%, PPV of 83.7%, and NPV of 80.9%).\nConclusion Overall, our findings demonstrate reliable, multivariable predictive models for 4 outcomes, that utilize readily available clinical information for COVID-19 adult inpatients. Further research is required to externally validate our models and demonstrate their utility as clinical decision-making tools."},

Despite these advantages, APSoCs are sensitive to radiation like any other electronic device. Processors embedded in APSoCs, therefore, have to be adequately hardened against ionizing-radiation to make them a viable choice of design for harsh environments. This paper proposes a novel lockstep-based approach to harden the dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor in the Xilinx Zynq-7000 APSoC against radiation-induced soft errors by coupling it with a MicroBlaze TMR subsystem in the programmable logic (PL) layer of the Zynq. The proposed technique uses the concepts of checkpointing along with roll-back and roll-forward mechanisms at the software level, i.e. software redundancy, as well as processor replication and checker circuits at the hardware level (i.e. hardware redundancy). Results of fault injection experiments show that the proposed approach achieves high levels of protection against soft errors by mitigating around 98% of bit-flips injected into the register files of both ARM cores while keeping timing performance overhead as low as 25% if block and application sizes are adjusted appropriately. Furthermore, the incorporation of the roll-forward recovery operation in addition to the roll-back operation improves the Mean Workload between Failures (MWBF) of the system by up to \u224819% depending on the nature of the running application, since the application can proceed faster, in a scenario where a fault occurs, when treated with the roll-forward operation rather than roll-back operation. Thus, relatively more data can be processed before the next error occurs in the system."},

The active combination of these two kinds of energy sectors is challenging but will unlock extra flexibility at the distribution level. Therefore, the EV battery (EVB) and local battery (LB) are studied in a hybrid scheme for the first time. The scheme delivers an improved optimal power schedule for the fast frequency regulation (FFR) in the microgrid. A hybrid power management strategy based on an improved model predictive control (IMPC) in a microgrid is developed. The IMPC is advanced by adding the battery degradation prediction and EV capacity prediction in the loop and designed for optimal power-sharing with the minimum effect on battery lifetime. The EV battery status, which is critical for both the IMPC and the battery degradation quantification, is predicted by the deep learning approach. The proposed hybrid power management with IMPC is verified to be very effective with optimal power-sharing and battery anti-aging control in the microgrid application."},

A tube shape and stacked opposing permanent magnets with magnetic spring were used to suit the shape constraint as well as to achieve high flux linkages. An initial prototype of electromagnetic vibration harvester with AA battery size was built and tested on a controllable shaker to obtain its output voltage and power level at different frequencies for fixed accelerations. A single magnet was fixed at the bottom of the harvester to provide levitation force in this development in order to lower the resonant frequency. A special time-domain based analytical model was also developed using both Finite Element Analysis and Simulink simulation. The time-domain analytical model is easier to implement than other frequency domain based analytical models which generally applied in literatures for modelling of the electromagnetic vibration energy harvesters. The analytical model was verified by the measured results obtained from the initial prototype. The validated analytical model was successfully applied to optimize the harvester. Two more generator prototypes were further built and tested after the optimization study. The optimized harvester using three stacked opposing permanent magnets could achieve a normalized power density of 12,655 \u03bcWcm\u22123 g\u22122 at 9.9 Hz frequency with 0.22 g acceleration, which is significantly higher than other reported electromagnetic vibration energy harvesters."},

Synonymous codons are those that code for the same amino acid. The difference in the frequency of occurrence of certain synonymous codons over other synonymous codons is called the codon usage bias (CUB). The Zeng and Charlesworth model is used to estimate the strength of CUB. In their model the evolutionary process is represented by a Markov model, which allows the population size to vary over time. In this paper we propose a new method that incorporates demographic changes into the model. The method is a hybrid of two optimizers, the first is evolutionary programming and the second is a version of the genetic algorithms that uses chromosomes of variable lengths, which allows for expressing more demographic changes than what the simplified model presented by Zeng and Charlesworth does. We conduct several simulations to show why this hybridization is necessary, and also to show the superior performance of this new hybrid."},

Recent studies have highlighted ECG analysis as an effective method of diagnosing SA. Because the changes caused by SA on the ECG are imperceptible, the need for new methods in diagnosing this disease is required more than ever. Machine Learning (ML) is recognized as one of the most successful methods of computer aided diagnosis. ML uses new methods to diagnose diseases using past clinical results. The purpose of this study is to evaluate studies using ML algorithms based on ECG characteristics to assess people suffering from SA. In this study, systematically-reviewed articles written in English before October 2020 and indexed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE databases were searched with no lower time limit. From these articles, 48 were selected for further review. The selected articles adopteddifferent ML methods for classification. All of these studies were binary where SA was detected from the normal state based on a full ECG stripe (per record), or based on one-minute segments (per segment). Our analysis show that the most common features used in the studies were frequency, time series, and statistical features. Support-Vector Machine (SVM) and deep learning-based neural network (i.e. CNN, DNN) performed best in full record data detection. The highest accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity reported among the selected studies were 100%, which was obtained by an SVM. In another study, the classification was conducted based on ECG segments, and accordingly, the highest classification accuracy was observed in the residual neural network algorithm (RNN). The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of this algorithm were reported to be 99%. In general, it can be stated that ML techniques based on ECG characteristics have a high capability in diagnosing SA. These techniques can increase the diagnosis of patients with SA or the detection of SA episodes on ECG record, and can potentially prevent complications of the disease at later stages."},

This study proposes a rudimentary competency framework with an associated progression model that aims to help teachers to plan, develop, self-assess, and reflect on existing and new competencies for teaching and learning through AI-based systems. The framework encompasses six competency themes along with six relational and inclusive descriptors of competency progression levels that may be used either as standalone or as a concerted set of competencies for enabling complete and holistic conceptualisations, and utilizations of competencies and capabilities that teachers may envisage to develop for making the leap into adaptive and automated AI-based teaching and learning. The AIED Comp framework may inform computational representation models and algorithms that focus on teacher-facing AIED applications and tools for gaining insights on skills and capabilities teachers may employ for innovating in their classroom."},

Applications range from the brain (EEG), the heart (ECG) and the financial markets (bid prices), to the sun (solar intensity readings) and river flows. HVGs have also been extended to image-based pattern recognition. Efficient and scalable online HVG construction is vital to extending HVG-based time series analysis to long, streaming, and distributed real-world time series data.The fastest scalable method for constructing HVGs today is the binary search tree (BST) encoding\u2013decoding algorithm, which is O(n log n) in time series length for balanced data such as noise. However, in practice BST is highly sensitive to the geometric structure of a time series and its performance degrades significantly towards O(n^2) when data possess long term dependencies or when the sample frequency is high, which occur regularly in practice. To avoid these problems we leverage an O(n) ordered rooted tree representation of time series that is (graph) dual to the HVG. We demonstrate that this representation leads to an algorithm for HVG construction that is agnostic with respect to the geometry and auto-correlations of the underlying data. Moreover, it possesses an efficient branch fusion operation for tree merging, leading to the idea of a bipartite HVG introduced in this paper, which allows HVGs for very large time series to be constructed efficiently in parallel.After introducing our method and algorithms for parallel construction of HVGs we report on experimental benchmarks comparing their real-world performance to existing approaches on long time series. On data sampled from fractional Brownian motions, deterministic chaotic systems, brain EEG recordings, and the financial markets, our dual tree algorithms significantly outperform previous methods."},

By means of Monte Carlo simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis we discuss the appearance of corrections to scaling for different definitions of cluster sets. We find that including all percolating clusters, or excluding only clusters that percolate in one but not the other direction, leads to smaller corrections to scaling for the average cluster size as compared to the other definitions considered. The percolation strength is less sensitive to the definitions used."}
